# Install the app
To get started, choose your operating system where you want to install the app:

- [Windows](#windows)
- [macOS](#macos)
- [Linux](#linux)

## Windows
AI Studio is only available for modern 64-bit Windows systems. When you have an older 32-bit system, you won't be able to run the app. We require an updated Windows 10 or 11 version; the app won't properly work on Windows 7 or 8. Next, we have to figure out if you have an Intel/AMD or a modern ARM system on your Windows machine.

- **Copilot Plus PC:** Do you own one of the new Copilot Plus PCs? If so, you most likely have an ARM system. When your machine has a Qualcomm sticker on it, you have an ARM system for sure. [Download the ARM version](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/releases/latest/download/MindWork%20AI%20Studio_arm64-setup.exe) of AI Studio.
- **Windows on macOS:** Do you run Windows using Parallels on an Apple Silicon system (M1, M2, M3, M4)? Then you have an ARM system as well. [Download the ARM version](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/releases/latest/download/MindWork%20AI%20Studio_arm64-setup.exe) of AI Studio.
- **Intel/AMD:** In almost all other cases, you have an Intel/AMD system. [Download the x64 version](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/releases/latest/download/MindWork%20AI%20Studio_x64-setup.exe) of AI Studio.

When you try to install the app, you get a message regarding protection of your PC. For Windows to trust our app, we need to purchase a certificate that costs around $1000 per year. Would you like to help us with this? [Please consider supporting us](../Sponsors.md). You might want to [visit our release page](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/releases/latest). There, we provide VirusTotal scan results for each release. If you are unsure about the safety of the app, you can check the results there. When you are confident in the app's safety, click on "More info" and then "Run anyway" to proceed with the installation:
