    @T("Relying on web services like ChatGPT was not a sustainable solution for me. I needed an AI that could also access files directly on my device, a functionality web services inherently lack due to security and privacy constraints. Although I could have scripted something in Python to meet my needs, this approach was too cumbersome for daily use. More importantly, I wanted to develop a solution that anyone could use without needing any programming knowledge.")

    @T("While exploring available solutions, I found a desktop application called Anything LLM. Unfortunately, it fell short of meeting my specific requirements and lacked the user interface design I envisioned. For macOS, there were several apps similar to what I had in mind, but they were all commercial solutions shrouded in uncertainty. The developers' identities and the origins of these apps were unclear, raising significant security concerns. Reports from users about stolen API keys and unwanted charges only amplified my reservations.")

Additionally, I wanted to demonstrate that it is possible to create modern, efficient, cross-platform applications without resorting to Electron bloatware. The combination of .NET and Rust with Tauri proved to be an excellent technology stack for building such robust applications.")
