        Ready to dive in and get started with MindWork AI Studio? This quick start guide will help you set up everything you need to start using the app.
        
        ## Step 1: Create an Account with OpenAI
        1. Go to [OpenAI's platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
        2. Click on "Sign up" and follow the instructions provided.
        
        ## Step 2: Obtain an API Key
        1. After creating your OpenAI account, ensure you have a project named "default".
        2. If you want, you can create a new project by clicking "Create project".
        3. Navigate to a project of your choice, then click on "API keys" in the left-hand navigation menu.
        4. You might need to validate your phone number. Click "Start verification" and follow the instructions.
        5. Once verified, click "Create new secret key" to generate a new API key for the selected project.
        6. Name your key something descriptive like "AI Studio Laptop."
        7. Copy the displayed secret key. Remember, you will not be able to see this key again.
        8. Store it in a password manager like [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org).
        9. **Important:** Treat your API key like a secret password. Anyone with access to your key can use OpenAI's systems **at your expense**. **Do not share it with anyone!**
        
        ## Step 3: Add OpenAI as a Provider in MindWork AI Studio
        1. Go to the settings section in MindWork AI Studio.
        2. Click "Add Provider" and select OpenAI as the provider.
        3. Paste your API key into the corresponding field.
        
        ## Step 4: Load OpenAI Models
        1. Ensure you have an internet connection and your API key is valid.
        2. Click "Reload" to retrieve a list of available OpenAI models.
        3. Select "gpt-4o" to use the latest model.
        4. Provide a name for this combination of provider, API key, and model. This is called the "instance name". For example, you can name it based on the usage context, such as "Personal OpenAI" or "Work OpenAI".
        
        ## Step 5: Save the Provider
        1. Click "Add" to save the provider.
        2. Depending on your operating system and settings, you may need to enter your login password. This is required to store and access your API key securely.
        
        ## Step 6: Add Funds to Your OpenAI Account
        To utilize OpenAI's services, you need to add funds to your account. It's best to use the prepaid method to avoid high bills and set your budget. Navigate to the "Billing" section. Here, you can see your current balance. Click on "Add to credit balance" to deposit an amount. A balance of $10 is sufficient to start.
        
        ## Step 7: Start Chatting with the AI
        1. Switch to the chat section in MindWork AI Studio.
        2. Select your provider from the dropdown menu at the top.
        3. Enter your question or message in the input field below to start your first chat with the AI.
        
        ## Additional Resources
        There are also video tutorials on how to obtain your OpenAI API key. One example is this video by Anders Jensen: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB99E7Y1cMA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OB99E7Y1cMA).
