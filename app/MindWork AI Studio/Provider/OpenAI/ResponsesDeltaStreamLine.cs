    // - As part of the delta content while streaming. That would be part of this class.
    // - By using a dedicated stream event and data structure. That would be another class implementing IResponseStreamLine.
    //
    // Right now, OpenAI uses the latter approach, so we don't have any sources here. And
    // because no other provider does it yet, we don't have any implementation here either.

    // One example where sources are part of the delta content is the Perplexity provider.
