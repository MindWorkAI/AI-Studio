            The ability to remember information correctly, but being wrong about the source of
            that information. Includes the following three sub-effects:

            - Source Confusion:
            Source confusion is an attribute seen in different people’s accounts of the same
            event after hearing people speak about the situation. An example of this would
            be a witness who heard a police officer say he had a gun and then that witness
            later says they saw the gun even though they didn’t. The source of the memory
            is the police officer’s testimony, not actual perception.

            - Cryptomnesia:
            Individuals mistakenly believe that they are the original generators of the
            thought.

            - False Memory:
            False memories occur when a person’s identity and interpersonal relationships
            are strongly centered around a memory of an experience that did not actually
            take place. False memories are often the result of leading questions in a
            therapeutic practice termed Recovered Memory Therapy. In this practice,
            psychiatrists often put their patients under hypnosis to recover repressed
            memories. This can be detrimental, as the individual may recall memories that
            never occurred.

            Prejudice can be an affective feeling towards a person based on their perceived group membership. The word

            person based on that person's perceived personal characteristics, such as political affiliation, sex,

            education, criminality, sport-team affiliation, music tastes or other perceived characteristics.

            The word "prejudice" can also refer to unfounded or pigeonholed beliefs and it may apply to
            "any unreasonable attitude that is unusually resistant to rational influence". Gordon Allport defined
            prejudice as a "feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on,
            actual experience". Auestad defines prejudice as characterized by "symbolic transfer", transfer of
            a value-laden meaning content onto a socially-formed category and then on to individuals who are taken to
            belong to that category, resistance to change, and overgeneralization.

            The United Nations Institute on Globalization, Culture and Mobility has highlighted research considering
            prejudice as a global security threat due to its use in scapegoating some populations and inciting others
            to commit violent acts towards them and how this can endanger individuals, countries, and the international

            including race or gender. Individuals' perceptions and behaviors can be affected by implicit stereotypes, even
            without the individuals' intention or awareness.

            An implicit bias or implicit stereotype is the pre-reflective attribution of particular qualities by an individual
            to a member of some social out group. Implicit stereotypes are thought to be shaped by experience and based on learned
            associations between particular qualities and social categories, including race and/or gender. Individuals' perceptions
            and behaviors can be influenced by the implicit stereotypes they hold, even if they are sometimes unaware they hold such
            stereotypes. Implicit bias is an aspect of implicit social cognition: the phenomenon that perceptions, attitudes, and
            stereotypes can operate prior to conscious intention or endorsement. The existence of implicit bias is supported by a
            variety of scientific articles in psychological literature. Implicit stereotype was first defined by psychologists
            Mahzarin Banaji and Anthony Greenwald in 1995.

            Explicit stereotypes, by contrast, are consciously endorsed, intentional, and sometimes controllable thoughts and beliefs.

            Implicit biases, however, are thought to be the product of associations learned through past experiences. Implicit
            biases can be activated by the environment and operate prior to a person's intentional, conscious endorsement. Implicit
            bias can persist even when an individual rejects the bias explicitly.

            as spaced repetition or spaced presentation, than by massed presentation ("cramming").

            The phenomenon was first identified by Hermann Ebbinghaus, and his detailed study of it was published in
            the 1885 book "Über das Gedächtnis. Untersuchungen zur experimentellen Psychologie" (Memory: A Contribution
            to Experimental Psychology), which suggests that active recall with increasing time intervals reduces the
            probability of forgetting information. This robust finding has been supported by studies of many explicit
            memory tasks such as free recall, recognition, cued-recall, and frequency estimation.

            Researchers have offered several possible explanations of the spacing effect, and much research has been
            conducted that supports its impact on recall. In spite of these findings, the robustness of this phenomenon
            and its resistance to experimental manipulation have made empirical testing of its parameters difficult.

            a scenario or moment. When the subject has been persistently told something about a past event, his or
            her memory of the event conforms to the repeated message.

            Suggestibility can be seen in people's day-to-day lives:

            - Someone witnesses an argument after school. When later asked about the "huge fight" that occurred, he

            - Children are told by their parents they are good singers, so from then on they believe they are talented
              while their parents were in fact being falsely encouraging.

            However, suggestibility can also be seen in extremes, resulting in negative consequences:

            - A witness' testimony is altered because the police or attorneys make suggestions during the interview,
              which causes their already uncertain observations to become distorted memories.

            # Tip of the Tongue Phenomenon
            Tip of the tongue (also known as TOT, or lethologica) is the phenomenon of failing to retrieve a word or term
            from memory, combined with partial recall and the feeling that retrieval is imminent. The phenomenon's name
            comes from the saying, "It's on the tip of my tongue." The tip of the tongue phenomenon reveals that
            lexical access occurs in stages.

            People experiencing the tip-of-the-tongue phenomenon can often recall one or more features of the target word,
            such as the first letter, its syllabic stress, and words similar in sound, meaning, or both sound and meaning.
            Individuals report a feeling of being seized by the state, feeling something like mild anguish while
            searching for the word, and a sense of relief when the word is found. While many aspects of the
            tip-of-the-tongue state remain unclear, there are two major competing explanations for its occurrence:
            the direct-access view and the inferential view. Emotion and the strength of the emotional ties to what
            is trying to be remembered can also have an impact on the TOT phenomenon. The stronger the emotional ties,
            the longer it takes to retrieve the item from memory.

            TOT states should be distinguished from FOK (feeling of knowing) states. FOK, in contrast, is the feeling
            that one will be able to recognize — from a list of items — an item that is currently inaccessible. There
            are still currently opposing hypotheses in the psychological literature regarding the separability of the
            process underlying these concepts. However, there is some evidence that TOTs and FOKs draw on different
            parts of the brain.

            The Google effect, also called digital amnesia, is the tendency to forget information that can be found
            readily online by using Internet search engines. According to the first study about the Google effect, people
            are less likely to remember certain details they believe will be accessible online. However, the study also
            claims that people's ability to learn information offline remains the same. This effect may also be seen
            as a change to what information and what level of detail is considered to be important to remember.

            In a big replication study published in Nature 2018, the Google effect was one of the experiments which
            could not be replicated.

            The next-in-line effect is the phenomenon of people being unable to recall information concerning events
            immediately preceding their turn to perform. The effect was first studied experimentally by Malcolm Brenner
            in 1973. In his experiment the participants were each in turn reading a word aloud from an index card, and
            after 25 words were asked to recall as many of all the read words as possible. The results of the experiment
            showed that words read aloud within approximately nine seconds before the subject's own turn were recalled
            worse than other words.

            The reason for the next-in-line effect appears to be a deficit in encoding the perceived information preceding
            a performance. That is, the information is never stored to long-term memory and thus cannot be retrieved later
            after the performance. One finding supporting this theory is that asking the subjects beforehand to pay more
            attention to events preceding their turn to perform can prevent the memory deficit and even result in
            overcompensation, making people remember the events before their turn better than others.

            In addition, the appearance of the next-in-line effect does not seem to be connected to the level of fear of
            negative evaluation. Both people with lower and higher anxiety levels are subject to the memory deficit.

            In the field of psychology, absent-mindedness is a mental state wherein a person is forgetfully inattentive.
            It is the opposite mental state of mindfulness. Absentmindedness is often caused by things such as boredom,
            sleepiness, rumination, distraction, or preoccupation with one's own internal monologue. When experiencing
            absent-mindedness, people exhibit signs of memory lapses and weak recollection of recent events.

            Absent-mindedness can usually be a result of a variety of other conditions often diagnosed by clinicians,
            such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and depression. In addition to absent-mindedness leading
            to an array of consequences affecting daily life, it can have more severe, long-term problems.

            It can have three different causes:
            1) a low level of attention ("blanking" or "zoning out");
            2) intense attention to a single object of focus (hyperfocus) that makes a person oblivious to events around him or her;
            3) unwarranted distraction of attention from the object of focus by irrelevant thoughts or environmental events.

            Absent-mindedness is also noticed as a common characteristic of personalities with schizoid personality
            disorder.

            The Levels of Processing model, created by Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S. Lockhart in 1972, describes memory recall
            of stimuli as a function of the depth of mental processing. More analysis produce more elaborate and stronger memory
            than lower levels of processing. Depth of processing falls on a shallow to deep continuum. Shallow processing (e.g.,
            processing based on phonemic and orthographic components) leads to a fragile memory trace that is susceptible to rapid
            decay. Conversely, deep processing (e.g., semantic processing) results in a more durable memory trace. There are three
            levels of processing in this model. (1) Structural processing, or visual, is when we remember only the physical quality
            of the word (e.g. how the word is spelled and how letters look). (2) Phonemic processing includes remembering the word
            by the way it sounds (e.g. the word tall rhymes with fall). (3) Lastly, we have semantic processing in which we encode
            the meaning of the word with another word that is similar or has similar meaning. Once the word is perceived, the
            brain allows for a deeper processing.

            # Serial-Position Effect
            Serial-position effect is the tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best,
            and the middle items worst. When asked to recall a list of items in any order (free recall), people tend
            to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those items best (the recency effect). Among earlier
            list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the primacy effect).

            One suggested reason for the primacy effect is that the initial items presented are most effectively stored
            in long-term memory because of the greater amount of processing devoted to them. (The first list item can
            be rehearsed by itself; the second must be rehearsed along with the first, the third along with the first
            and second, and so on.) The primacy effect is reduced when items are presented quickly and is enhanced
            when presented slowly (factors that reduce and enhance processing of each item and thus permanent storage).
            Longer presentation lists have been found to reduce the primacy effect.

            One theorised reason for the recency effect is that these items are still present in working memory when
            recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are recalled most poorly. An
            additional explanation for the recency effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after
            rehearsal, the current temporal context can serve as a retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items
            to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different temporal context (earlier
            in the list). The recency effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve
            working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the
            recency effect. Additionally, if recall comes immediately after the test, the recency effect is consistent
            regardless of the length of the studied list, or presentation rate.

            Amnesiacs with poor ability to form permanent long-term memories do not show a primacy effect, but do show
            a recency effect if recall comes immediately after study. People with Alzheimer's disease exhibit a
            reduced primacy effect but do not produce a recency effect in recall.

            In psychology, memory inhibition is the ability not to remember irrelevant information. The scientific concept of memory

            is a type of cognitive inhibition, which is the stopping or overriding of a mental process, in whole or in part, with or
            without intention.

            Memory inhibition is a critical component of an effective memory system. While some memories are retained for a lifetime,
            most memories are forgotten. According to evolutionary psychologists, forgetting is adaptive because it facilitates
            selectivity of rapid, efficient recollection. For example, a person trying to remember where they parked their car
            would not want to remember every place they have ever parked. In order to remember something, therefore, it is essential

            A mental shortcut that relies on immediate examples that come to a given person’s mind when evaluating
            a specific topic, concept, method or decision. The availability heuristic operates on the notion that
            if something can be recalled, it must be important, or at least more important than alternative
            solutions which are not as readily recalled. Subsequently, under the availability heuristic, people
            tend to heavily weigh their judgments toward more recent information, making new opinions biased
            toward that latest news.
            
            The mental availability of an action's consequences is positively related to those consequences'
            perceived magnitude. In other words, the easier it is to recall the consequences of something,
            the greater those consequences are often perceived to be. Most notably, people often rely on the
            content of their recall if its implications are not called into question by the difficulty they
            have in recalling it.
            
            After seeing news stories about child abductions, people may judge that the likelihood of this event
            is greater. Media coverage can help fuel a person's example bias with widespread and extensive coverage
            of unusual events, such as homicide or airline accidents, and less coverage of more routine, less
            sensational events, such as common diseases or car accidents. For example, when asked to rate the
            probability of a variety of causes of death, people tend to rate "newsworthy" events as more likely
            because they can more readily recall an example from memory. Moreover, unusual and vivid events
            like homicides, shark attacks, or lightning are more often reported in mass media than common and
            un-sensational causes of death like common diseases.
            
            For example, many people think that the likelihood of dying from shark attacks is greater than that
            of dying from being hit by falling airplane parts when more people actually die from falling airplane
            parts. When a shark attack occurs, the deaths are widely reported in the media whereas deaths as a
            result of being hit by falling airplane parts are rarely reported in the media.

            # Illusory Truth Effect
            The illusory truth effect (also known as the illusion of truth effect, validity effect, truth effect,
            or the reiteration effect) is the tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated
            exposure. This phenomenon was first identified in a 1977 study at Villanova University and Temple
            University. When truth is assessed, people rely on whether the information is in line with their
            understanding or if it feels familiar. The first condition is logical, as people compare new information
            with what they already know to be true. Repetition makes statements easier to process relative to new,
            unrepeated statements, leading people to believe that the repeated conclusion is more truthful. The
            illusory truth effect has also been linked to hindsight bias, in which the recollection of confidence
            is skewed after the truth has been received.
            
            In a 2015 study, researchers discovered that familiarity can overpower rationality and that repetitively
            hearing that a certain statement is wrong can paradoxically cause it to feel right. Researchers
            observed the illusory truth effect's impact even on participants who knew the correct answer to begin
            with but were persuaded to believe otherwise through the repetition of a falsehood, to "processing fluency".
            
            The illusory truth effect plays a significant role in fields such as advertising, news media, and
            political propaganda.

            # Mere-Exposure Effect
            The mere-exposure effect is a psychological phenomenon by which people tend to develop liking or disliking for
            things merely because they are familiar with them. In social psychology, this effect is sometimes called the
            familiarity principle. The effect has been demonstrated with many kinds of things, including words, Chinese
            characters, paintings, pictures of faces, geometric figures, and sounds. In studies of interpersonal
            attraction, the more often people see a person, the more pleasing and likeable they find that person.
            
            The most obvious application of the mere-exposure effect is in advertising, but research on its effectiveness at
            enhancing consumer attitudes toward particular companies and products has been mixed.
            
            The mere-exposure effect exists in most areas of human decision-making. For example, many stock traders tend
            to invest in securities of domestic companies merely because they are more familiar with them, even though
            international markets offer similar or better alternatives. The mere-exposure effect also distorts the
            results of journal-ranking surveys; academics who previously published or completed reviews for a particular
            academic journal rate it dramatically higher than those who did not. There are mixed results on the question
            of whether mere exposure can promote good relations between different social groups. When groups already
            have negative attitudes to each other, further exposure can increase hostility. A statistical analysis of
            voting patterns found that candidates' exposure has a strong effect on the number of votes they receive,
            distinct from the popularity of their policies.

            # Context Effect
            A context effect is an aspect of cognitive psychology that describes the influence of environmental factors
            on one's perception of a stimulus. The impact of context effects is considered to be part of top-down
            design. The concept is supported by the theoretical approach to perception known as constructive perception.
            Context effects can impact our daily lives in many ways such as word recognition, learning abilities, memory,
            and object recognition. It can have an extensive effect on marketing and consumer decisions. For example,
            research has shown that the comfort level of the floor that shoppers are standing on while reviewing products
            can affect their assessments of product's quality, leading to higher assessments if the floor is comfortable
            and lower ratings if it is uncomfortable. Because of effects such as this, context effects are currently
            studied predominantly in marketing.
            
            Context effects can have a wide range of impacts in daily life. In reading difficult handwriting context
            effects are used to determine what letters make up a word. This helps us analyze potentially ambiguous
            messages and decipher them correctly. It can also affect our perception of unknown sounds based on the noise
            in the environment. For example, we may fill in a word we cannot make out in a sentence based on the
            other words we could understand. Context can prime our attitudes and beliefs about certain topics based
            on current environmental factors and our previous experiences with them.
            
            Context effects also affect memory. We are often better able to recall information in the location in which
            we learned it or studied it. For example, while studying for a test it is better to study in the environment
            that the test will be taken in (i.e. classroom) than in a location where the information was not learned
            and will not need to be recalled. This phenomenon is called transfer-appropriate processing.

            Upon performing a search for files in a computer, its memory is scanned for words. Relevant files containing

            can not be recalled by simply thinking about them. Rather, one must think about something associated
            with it.
            
            For example, if someone tries and fails to recollect the memories they had about a vacation they went on,
            and someone mentions the fact that they hired a classic car during this vacation, this may make them remember

            In psychology, context-dependent memory is the improved recall of specific episodes or information when the
            context present at encoding and retrieval are the same. In a simpler manner, "when events are represented
            in memory, contextual information is stored along with memory targets; the context can therefore cue memories
            containing that contextual information". One particularly common example of context-dependence at work occurs
            when an individual has lost an item (e.g. lost car keys) in an unknown location. Typically, people try to
            systematically "retrace their steps" to determine all of the possible places where the item might be located.
            Based on the role that context plays in determining recall, it is not at all surprising that individuals often
            quite easily discover the lost item upon returning to the correct context. This concept is heavily related to
            the encoding specificity principle.
            
            This example best describes the concept of context-dependent forgetting. However, the research literature on
            context-dependent memory describes a number of different types of contextual information that may affect
            recall such as environmental context-dependent memory, state-dependent learning, cognitive context-dependent
            memory and mood-congruent memory. Research has also shown that context-dependence may play an important role

            consumption of alcohol or other drugs.

            The name "Baader–Meinhof phenomenon" was coined in 1994 by Terry Mullen in a letter to the St. Paul

            the phenomenon, leading it to gain recognition. It was not until 2005, when Stanford linguistics

            was coined.

            A hot-cold empathy gap is a cognitive bias in which people underestimate the influences of visceral
            drives on their own attitudes, preferences, and behaviors. It is a type of empathy gap. The most
            important aspect of this idea is that human understanding is "state-dependent". For example, when
            one is angry, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one to be calm, and vice versa;
            when one is blindly in love with someone, it is difficult to understand what it is like for one
            not to be, (or to imagine the possibility of not being blindly in love in the future). Importantly,
            an inability to minimize one's gap in empathy can lead to negative outcomes in medical settings
            (e.g., when a doctor needs to accurately diagnose the physical pain of a patient).
            
            Hot-cold empathy gaps can be analyzed according to their direction:
            
            - Hot-to-cold: People under the influence of visceral factors (hot state) do not fully grasp how
              much their behavior and preferences are being driven by their current state; they think instead
              that these short-term goals reflect their general and long-term preferences.
              
            - Cold-to-hot: People in a cold state have difficulty picturing themselves in hot states, minimizing
              the motivational strength of visceral impulses. This leads to unpreparedness when visceral forces
              inevitably arise.
              
            They can also be classified in regards to their relation with time (past or future) and whether they
            occur intra- or inter-personally:
            
            - intrapersonal prospective: the inability to effectively predict their own future behavior when in
              a different state. See also projection bias.
              
            - intrapersonal retrospective: when people recall or try to understand behaviors that happened in a
              different state.
              
            - interpersonal: the attempt to evaluate behaviors or preferences of another person who is in a
              state different from one's own.
            
            Visceral factors
            Visceral factors are an array of influences which include hunger, thirst, love, sexual arousal,
            drug cravings for the drugs one is addicted to, physical pain, and desire for revenge. These
            drives have a disproportionate effect on decision making and behavior: the mind, when affected
            (i.e., in a hot state), tends to ignore all other goals in an effort to placate these influences.
            These states can lead a person to feel "out of control" and act impulsively.

            suggests it doesn't exist and some suggests it leads to worse remembering.
            
            McDaniel and Einstein argues that bizarreness intrinsically does not enhance memory in their paper
            from 1986. They claim that bizarre information becomes distinctive. It is the distinctiveness that
            according to them makes encoding easier. Which makes common sense from an instinctual perspective
            as the human brain will disregard ingesting information it already is familiar with and will be
            particularly attuned to taking in new information as an adaptation technique.

            homogeneous stimuli are presented, the stimulus that differs from the rest is more likely
            to be remembered. The theory was coined by German psychiatrist and pediatrician Hedwig
            von Restorff (1906–1962), who, in her 1933 study, found that when participants were presented
            with a list of categorically similar items with one distinctive, isolated item on the list,
            memory for the item was improved.
            
            For example, if a person examines a shopping list with one item highlighted in bright green,
            he or she will be more likely to remember the highlighted item than any of the others.
            Additionally, in the following list of words – desk, chair, bed, table, chipmunk, dresser,
            stool, couch – "chipmunk" will be remembered the most as it stands out against the other
            words in its meaning.
            
            There have been many studies that demonstrate and confirm the von Restorff effect in children
            and young adults. Another study found that college-aged students performed better when trying
            to remember an outstanding item in a list during an immediate memory-task whereas elderly
            individuals did not remember it well, suggesting a difference in processing strategies
            between the age groups.
            
            In yet another study, although a significant von Restorff effect was produced amongst both
            age groups when manipulating font color, it was found to be smaller in older adults than
            younger adults. This too indicates that older people display lesser benefits for distinctive
            information compared to younger people.

            The anchoring effect is a psychological phenomenon in which an individual's judgments or decisions
            are influenced by a reference point or "anchor" which can be completely irrelevant. Both numeric
            and non-numeric anchoring have been reported in research. In numeric anchoring, once the value
            of the anchor is set, subsequent arguments, estimates, etc. made by an individual may change
            from what they would have otherwise been without the anchor. For example, an individual may
            be more likely to purchase a car if it is placed alongside a more expensive model (the anchor).
            Prices discussed in negotiations that are lower than the anchor may seem reasonable, perhaps
            even cheap to the buyer, even if said prices are still relatively higher than the actual market
            value of the car. Another example may be when estimating the orbit of Mars, one might start
            with the Earth's orbit (365 days) and then adjust upward until they reach a value that seems
            reasonable (usually less than 687 days, the correct answer).
            
            The original description of the anchoring effect came from psychophysics. When judging stimuli
            along a continuum, it was noticed that the first and last stimuli were used to compare the other
            stimuli (this is also referred to as "end anchoring"). This was applied to attitudes by Sherif
            et al. in their 1958 article "Assimilation and effects of anchoring stimuli on judgments".
            
            Anchoring in negotiation
            In the negotiation process anchoring serves to determine an accepted starting point for the
            subsequent negotiations. As soon as one side states their first price offer, the (subjective)
            anchor is set. The counterbid (counter-anchor) is the second-anchor.

            The framing effect is a cognitive bias in which people decide between options based on whether the options

            or choices when options are positively framed, while selecting more loss-avoidant options when presented with
            a negative frame. In studies of the bias, options are presented in terms of the probability of either
            losses or gains. While differently expressed, the options described are in effect identical. Gain and

            treated or not treated, monetary gains or losses.
            
            Prospect theory posits that a loss is more significant than the equivalent gain, that a sure gain (certainty
            effect and pseudocertainty effect) is favored over a probabilistic gain, and that a probabilistic loss is
            preferred to a definite loss. One of the dangers of framing effects is that people are often provided with

            # Money Illusion
            In economics, money illusion, or price illusion, is a cognitive bias where money is thought of in nominal,
            rather than real terms. In other words, the face value (nominal value) of money is mistaken for its
            purchasing power (real value) at a previous point in time. Viewing purchasing power as measured by the
            nominal value is false, as modern fiat currencies have no intrinsic value and their real value depends
            purely on the price level. The term was coined by Irving Fisher in *Stabilizing the Dollar*. It was
            popularized by John Maynard Keynes in the early twentieth century, and Irving Fisher wrote an important
            book on the subject, *The Money Illusion*, in 1928.
            
            The existence of money illusion is disputed by monetary economists who contend that people act rationally
            (i.e. think in real prices) with regard to their wealth. Eldar Shafir, Peter A. Diamond, and Amos
            Tversky (1997) have provided empirical evidence for the existence of the effect and it has been shown to
            affect behaviour in a variety of experimental and real-world situations.
            
            Shafir et al. also state that money illusion influences economic behaviour in three main ways:
            
            - Price stickiness. Money illusion has been proposed as one reason why nominal prices are slow to change
              even where inflation has caused real prices to fall or costs to rise.
              
            - Contracts and laws are not indexed to inflation as frequently as one would rationally expect.
            
            - Social discourse, in formal media and more generally, reflects some confusion about real and nominal value.
            
            Money illusion can also influence people's perceptions of outcomes. Experiments have shown that people
            generally perceive an approximate 2% cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair,
            but see a 2% rise in nominal income where there is 4% inflation as fair, despite them being almost rational
            equivalents. This result is consistent with the 'Myopic Loss Aversion theory'. Furthermore, the money illusion
            means nominal changes in price can influence demand even if real prices have remained constant.

            The Weber–Fechner laws are two related scientific laws in the field of psychophysics, known as Weber's law and
            Fechner's law. Both relate to human perception, more specifically the relation between the actual change in a
            physical stimulus and the perceived change. This includes stimuli to all senses: vision, hearing, taste, touch,
            and smell.
            
            Ernst Heinrich Weber states that "the minimum increase of stimulus which will produce a perceptible increase
            of sensation is proportional to the pre-existent stimulus," while Gustav Fechner's law is an inference from
            Weber's law (with additional assumptions) which states that the intensity of our sensation increases as the
            logarithm of an increase in energy rather than as rapidly as the increase.
            
            Psychological studies show that it becomes increasingly difficult to discriminate between two numbers as the
            difference between them decreases. This is called the distance effect. This is important in areas of magnitude
            estimation, such as dealing with large scales and estimating distances. It may also play a role in explaining
            why consumers neglect to shop around to save a small percentage on a large purchase, but will shop around to
            save a large percentage on a small purchase which represents a much smaller absolute dollar amount.
            
            Preliminary research has found that pleasant emotions adhere to Weber’s Law, with accuracy in judging their
            intensity decreasing as pleasantness increases. However, this pattern wasn't observed for unpleasant emotions,
            suggesting a survival-related need for accurately discerning high-intensity negative emotions.

            desired outcomes, for emotionally charged issues, and for deeply entrenched beliefs.
            
            In social media, confirmation bias is amplified by the use of filter bubbles, or "algorithmic editing", which
            displays to individuals only information they are likely to agree with, while excluding opposing views. Some
            have argued that confirmation bias is the reason why society can never escape from filter bubbles, because
            individuals are psychologically hardwired to seek information that agrees with their preexisting values and
            beliefs. Others have further argued that the mixture of the two is degrading democracy—claiming that this
            "algorithmic editing" removes diverse viewpoints and information—and that unless filter bubble algorithms
            are removed, voters will be unable to make fully informed political decisions.
            
            Many times in the history of science, scientists have resisted new discoveries by selectively interpreting or
            ignoring unfavorable data. Several studies have shown that scientists rate studies that report findings
            consistent with their prior beliefs more favorably than studies reporting findings inconsistent with
            their previous beliefs. Further, confirmation biases can sustain scientific theories or research programs
            in the face of inadequate or even contradictory evidence. The discipline of parapsychology is often cited
            as an example.

            The observer-expectancy effect[a] is a form of reactivity in which a researcher's cognitive bias causes them to
            subconsciously influence the participants of an experiment. Confirmation bias can lead to the experimenter
            interpreting results incorrectly because of the tendency to look for information that conforms to their hypothesis,
            and overlook information that argues against it. It is a significant threat to a study's internal validity, and
            is therefore typically controlled using a double-blind experimental design.
            
            The classic example of experimenter bias is that of "Clever Hans", an Orlov Trotter horse claimed by his owner
            von Osten to be able to do arithmetic and other tasks. As a result of the large public interest in Clever Hans,
            philosopher and psychologist Carl Stumpf, along with his assistant Oskar Pfungst, investigated these claims.
            Ruling out simple fraud, Pfungst determined that the horse could answer correctly even when von Osten did not
            ask the questions. However, the horse was unable to answer correctly when either it could not see the questioner,
            or if the questioner themselves was unaware of the correct answer: When von Osten knew the answers to the questions,
            Hans answered correctly 89% of the time. However, when von Osten did not know the answers, Hans guessed only 6% of
            questions correctly. Pfungst then proceeded to examine the behaviour of the questioner in detail, and showed that
            as the horse's taps approached the right answer, the questioner's posture and facial expression changed in ways
            that were consistent with an increase in tension, which was released when the horse made the final, correct tap.
            This provided a cue that the horse had learned to use as a reinforced cue to stop tapping.

            effect is a cognitive bias where people tend to “bury their head in the sand” and avoid potentially negative
            but useful information, such as feedback on progress, to avoid psychological discomfort.
            
            There is neuroscientific evidence of the ostrich effect. Sharot et al. (2012) investigated the differences in
            positive and negative information when updating existing beliefs. Consistent with the ostrich effect,
            participants presented with negative information were more likely to avoid updating their beliefs.
            
            An everyday example of the ostrich effect in a financial context is people avoiding checking their bank account
            balance after spending a lot of money. There are known negative implications of the ostrich effect in healthcare.

            The introspection illusion is a cognitive bias in which people wrongly think they have direct insight into the origins
            of their mental states, while treating others' introspections as unreliable. The illusion has been examined in
            psychological experiments, and suggested as a basis for biases in how people compare themselves to others. These
            experiments have been interpreted as suggesting that, rather than offering direct access to the processes underlying
            mental states, introspection is a process of construction and inference, much as people indirectly infer others' mental
            states from their behaviour.
            
            When people mistake unreliable introspection for genuine self-knowledge, the result can be an illusion of superiority
            over other people, for example when each person thinks they are less biased and less conformist than the rest of the
            group. Even when experimental subjects are provided with reports of other subjects' introspections, in as detailed a
            form as possible, they still rate those other introspections as unreliable while treating their own as reliable.
            Although the hypothesis of an introspection illusion informs some psychological research, the existing evidence is
            arguably inadequate to decide how reliable introspection is in normal circumstances.
            
            The phrase "introspection illusion" was coined by Emily Pronin. Pronin describes the illusion as having four components:
            
            - People give a strong weighting to introspective evidence when assessing themselves.
            
            - They do not give such a strong weight when assessing others.
            
            - People disregard their own behaviour when assessing themselves (but not others).
            
            - Own introspections are more highly weighted than others. It is not just that people lack access to each other's
              introspections: they regard only their own as reliable.

            # Naïve Cynicism
            Naïve cynicism is a philosophy of mind, cognitive bias and form of psychological egoism that occurs when
            people naïvely expect more egocentric bias in others than actually is the case.
            
            The term was formally proposed by Justin Kruger and Thomas Gilovich and has been studied across a wide range
            of contexts including: negotiations, group-membership, marriage, economics, government policy and more.
            
            The theory of naïve cynicism can be described as:
            
            - I am not biased.
            - You are biased if you disagree with me.
            - Your intentions/actions reflect your underlying egocentric biases.
            
            As with naïve cynicism, the theory of naïve realism hinges on the acceptance of the following three beliefs:
            
            - I am not biased.
            - Reasonable people are not biased.
            - All others are biased.
            
            Naïve cynicism can be thought of as the counter to naïve realism, which is the belief that an individual
            perceives the social world objectively while others perceive it subjectively.
            
            It is important to discern that naïve cynicism is related to the notion that others have an egocentric bias
            that motivates them to do things for their own self-interest rather than for altruistic reasons.
            
            Both of these theories, however, relate to the extent that adults credit or discredit the beliefs or statements
            of others.
            
            Example: Cold War
            The American reaction to a Russian SALT treaty during the Cold War is one well-known example of naïve cynicism
            in history. Political leaders negotiating on behalf of the United States discredited the offer simply because
            it was proposed by the Russian side.
            
            Former U.S. congressman Floyd Spence indicates the use of naïve cynicism in this quote:
            "I have had a philosophy for some time in regard to SALT, and it goes like this: the Russians will not accept
            a SALT treaty that is not in their best interest, and it seems to me that if it is their best interests, it
            can‘t be in our best interest."

            In social psychology, naïve realism is the human tendency to believe that we see the world around us objectively,
            and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, irrational, or biased.
            
            Naïve realism provides a theoretical basis for several other cognitive biases, which are systematic errors when it
            comes to thinking and making decisions. These include the false consensus effect, actor–observer bias, bias blind
            spot, and fundamental attribution error, among others.
            
            Lee Ross and fellow psychologist Andrew Ward have outlined three interrelated assumptions, or "tenets", that make up
            naïve realism. They argue that these assumptions are supported by a long line of thinking in social psychology,
            along with several empirical studies. According to their model, people:
            
            - Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.
            
            - Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and
            interpret it in a rational manner.

            are the same object, then A and B are indiscernible (that is, they have all the same properties). By modus tollens,
            this means that if one object has a certain property, while another object does not have the same property, the two
            objects cannot be identical. The fallacy is "epistemic" because it posits an immediate identity between a subject's
            knowledge of an object with the object itself, failing to recognize that Leibniz's Law is not capable of accounting
            for intensional contexts.

            - Premise 2: I do not know who the masked man is.

            expected, it is more likely to happen again in the future (or vice versa). The fallacy is commonly associated with
            gambling, where it may be believed, for example, that the next dice roll is more than usually likely to be six
            because there have recently been fewer than the expected number of sixes.
            
            In a study aimed at discovering if the negative autocorrelation that exists with the gambler's fallacy existed in
            the decision made by U.S. asylum judges, results showed that after two successive asylum grants, a judge would be
            5.5% less likely to approve a third grant.
            
            In the decision making of loan officers, it can be argued that monetary incentives are a key factor in biased
            decision making, rendering it harder to examine the gambler's fallacy effect. However, research shows that loan
            officers who are not incentivised by monetary gain are 8% less likely to approve a loan if they approved one
            for the previous client.
            
            Several video games feature the use of loot boxes, a collection of in-game items awarded on opening with random
            contents set by rarity metrics, as a monetization scheme. Since around 2018, loot boxes have come under scrutiny
            from governments and advocates on the basis they are akin to gambling, particularly for games aimed at youth.
            Some games use a special "pity-timer" mechanism, that if the player has opened several loot boxes in a row
            without obtaining a high-rarity item, subsequent loot boxes will improve the odds of a higher-rate item drop.
            This is considered to feed into the gambler's fallacy since it reinforces the idea that a player will eventually
            obtain a high-rarity item (a win) after only receiving common items from a string of previous loot boxes.

            The "hot hand" (also known as the "hot hand phenomenon" or "hot hand fallacy") is a phenomenon, previously
            considered a cognitive social bias, that a person who experiences a successful outcome has a greater
            chance of success in further attempts. The concept is often applied to sports and skill-based tasks
            in general and originates from basketball, where a shooter is more likely to score if their previous
            attempts were successful; i.e., while having the "hot hand.” While previous success at a task can indeed
            change the psychological attitude and subsequent success rate of a player, researchers for many years
            did not find evidence for a "hot hand" in practice, dismissing it as fallacious. However, later research
            questioned whether the belief is indeed a fallacy. Some recent studies using modern statistical
            analysis have observed evidence for the "hot hand" in some sporting activities; however, other recent
            studies have not observed evidence of the "hot hand". Moreover, evidence suggests that only a small
            subset of players may show a "hot hand" and, among those who do, the magnitude (i.e., effect size) of the
            "hot hand" tends to be small.

            stereotypes can lead people to expect certain groups and traits to fit together, and then to overestimate
            the frequency with which these correlations actually occur. These stereotypes can be learned and perpetuated
            without any actual contact occurring between the holder of the stereotype and the group it is about.

            close purse each time she sees a similar person.

            In psychology, an attribution bias or attributional errors is a cognitive bias that refers to the
            systematic errors made when people evaluate or try to find reasons for their own and others' behaviors.
            It refers to the systematic patterns of deviation from norm or rationality in judgment, often leading to
            perceptual distortions, inaccurate assessments, or illogical interpretations of events and behaviors.
            
            Attributions are the judgments and assumptions people make about why others behave a certain way. However,
            these judgments may not always reflect the true situation. Instead of being completely objective, people
            often make errors in perception that lead to skewed interpretations of social situations. Attribution
            biases are present in everyday life. For example, when a driver cuts someone off, the person who has been
            cut off is often more likely to attribute blame to the reckless driver's inherent personality traits (e.g.,
            "That driver is rude and incompetent") rather than situational circumstances (e.g., "That driver may have
            been late to work and was not paying attention").
            
            Additionally, there are many different types of attribution biases, such as the ultimate attribution error,
            fundamental attribution error, actor-observer bias, and hostile attribution bias. Each of these biases

            In-group favoritism, sometimes known as in-group–out-group bias, in-group bias, intergroup bias, or
            in-group preference, is a pattern of favoring members of one's in-group over out-group members.
            This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.
            
            This effect has been researched by many psychologists and linked to many theories related to group 
            conflict and prejudice. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a social psychology standpoint.
            Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups.
            These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time,
            populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behavior, increasing covariation. This
            then incentivizes in-group bias.
            
            Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are realistic conflict
            theory and social identity theory. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition,
            and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources.
            In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for positively distinct social
            identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.

            Essentialism has emerged as an important concept in psychology, particularly developmental psychology.
            In 1991, Kathryn Kremer and Susan Gelman studied the extent to which children from four–seven years old
            demonstrate essentialism. Children believed that underlying essences predicted observable behaviours.
            Children were able to describe living objects' behaviour as self-perpetuated and non-living objects'
            behavior as a result of an adult influencing the object. Understanding the underlying causal mechanism
            for behaviour suggests essentialist thinking. Younger children were unable to identify causal
            mechanisms of behaviour whereas older children were able to. This suggests that essentialism is rooted
            in cognitive development. It can be argued that there is a shift in the way that children represent
            entities, from not understanding the causal mechanism of the underlying essence to showing sufficient
            understanding.

            Functional fixedness is a cognitive bias that limits a person to use an object only in the way it is traditionally
            used. The concept of functional fixedness originated in Gestalt psychology, a movement in psychology that emphasizes
            holistic processing. Karl Duncker defined functional fixedness as being a mental block against using an object in a
            new way that is required to solve a problem. This "block" limits the ability of an individual to use components given
            to them to complete a task, as they cannot move past the original purpose of those components. For example, if someone
            needs a paperweight, but they only have a hammer, they may not see how the hammer can be used as a paperweight.
            Functional fixedness is this inability to see a hammer's use as anything other than for pounding nails; the person
            couldn't think to use the hammer in a way other than in its conventional function.
            
            When tested, 5-year-old children show no signs of functional fixedness. It has been argued that this is because at
            age 5, any goal to be achieved with an object is equivalent to any other goal. However, by age 7, children have
            acquired the tendency to treat the originally intended purpose of an object as special.

            # Moral Credential Effect
            Self-licensing (also moral self-licensing, moral licensing, or licensing effect) is a term used in social
            psychology and marketing to describe the subconscious phenomenon whereby increased confidence and security
            in one's self-image or self-concept tends to make that individual worry less about the consequences of
            subsequent immoral behavior and, therefore, more likely to make immoral choices and act immorally.
            In simple terms, self-licensing occurs when people allow themselves to indulge after doing something positive
            first; for example, drinking a diet soda with a greasy hamburger and fries can lead one to subconsciously
            discount the negative attributes of the meal's high caloric and cholesterol content.
            
            A large subset of this effect, the moral credential effect, is a bias that occurs when a person's track
            record as a good egalitarian establishes in them an unconscious ethical certification, endorsement, or
            license that increases the likelihood of less egalitarian decisions later. This effect occurs even when
            the audience or moral peer group is unaware of the affected person's previously established moral credential.
            For example, individuals who had the opportunity to recruit a woman or Black person in one setting were more
            likely to say later, in a different setting, that a job would be better suited for a man or a white person.
            Similar effects also appear to occur when a person observes another person from a group they identify with
            making an egalitarian decision.
            
            Self-licensing can have negative societal consequences since it has a permissive effect on behaviors such
            as racial prejudice and discrimination, selfishness, poor dietary and health habits, and excessive
            energy consumption.
            
            But recent scholarship has failed to replicate seminal studies of the licensing effect, and meta-analysis
            found it to be exaggerated by publication bias. Furthermore, where licensing typically assumes that a
            good deed is the cause that makes subsequent transgressions more likely, an alternative (or additional)
            account is that people are faced with a temptation to do something morally dubious, and use a prior good
            deed as an excuse or reason why it is allowed for them to indulge.

            they deserve" – that actions will necessarily have morally fair and fitting consequences for the actor.
            For example, the assumptions that noble actions will eventually be rewarded and evil actions will eventually
            be punished fall under this fallacy. In other words, the just-world fallacy is the tendency to attribute
            consequences to—or expect consequences as the result of— either a universal force that restores moral balance
            or a universal connection between the nature of actions and their results. This belief generally implies the
            existence of cosmic justice, destiny, divine providence, desert, stability, order, or the anglophone colloquial
            use of "karma". It is often associated with a variety of fundamental fallacies, especially in regard to
            rationalizing suffering on the grounds that the sufferers "deserve" it. This is called victim blaming.
            
            This fallacy popularly appears in the English language in various figures of speech that imply guaranteed
            punishment for wrongdoing, such as: "you got what was coming to you", "what goes around comes around",
            "chickens come home to roost", "everything happens for a reason", and "you reap what you sow". This
            hypothesis has been widely studied by social psychologists since Melvin J. Lerner conducted seminal work
            on the belief in a just world in the early 1960s. Research has continued since then, examining the
            predictive capacity of the fallacy in various situations and across cultures, and clarifying and expanding
            the theoretical understandings of just-world beliefs.

            # Automation Bias
            Automation bias is the propensity for humans to favor suggestions from automated decision-making systems and to
            ignore contradictory information made without automation, even if it is correct. Automation bias stems from
            the social psychology literature that found a bias in human-human interaction that showed that people assign more
            positive evaluations to decisions made by humans than to a neutral object. The same type of positivity bias
            has been found for human-automation interaction, where the automated decisions are rated more positively
            than neutral. This has become a growing problem for decision making as intensive care units, nuclear power
            plants, and aircraft cockpits have increasingly integrated computerized system monitors and decision aids
            to mostly factor out possible human error. Errors of automation bias tend to occur when decision-making
            is dependent on computers or other automated aids and the human is in an observatory role but able to
            make decisions. Examples of automation bias range from urgent matters like flying a plane on automatic
            pilot to such mundane matters as the use of spell-checking programs.
            
            An operator's trust in the system can also lead to different interactions with the system, including system
            use, misuse, disuse, and abuse. Automation use and disuse can also influence stages of information processing:
            information acquisition, information analysis, decision making and action selection, and action implementation.
            
            For example, information acquisition, the first step in information processing, is the process by which a user
            registers input via the senses. An automated engine gauge might assist the user with information acquisition
            through simple interface features—such as highlighting changes in the engine's performance—thereby directing
            the user's selective attention. When faced with issues originating from an aircraft, pilots may tend to
            overtrust an aircraft's engine gauges, losing sight of other possible malfunctions not related to the engine.
            This attitude is a form of automation complacency and misuse. If, however, the pilot devotes time to interpret
            the engine gauge, and manipulate the aircraft accordingly, only to discover that the flight turbulence has not
            changed, the pilot may be inclined to ignore future error recommendations conveyed by an engine gauge—a form
            of automation complacency leading to disuse.

            The bandwagon effect is a psychological phenomenon where people adopt certain behaviors, styles, or attitudes
            simply because others are doing so. More specifically, it is a cognitive bias by which public opinion or
            behaviours can alter due to particular actions and beliefs rallying amongst the public. It is a psychological
            phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases with respect to the proportion
            of others who have already done so. As more people come to believe in something, others also "hop on the bandwagon"
            regardless of the underlying evidence.
            
            Following others' actions or beliefs can occur because of conformism or deriving information from others. Much of
            the influence of the bandwagon effect comes from the desire to 'fit in' with peers; by making similar selections
            as other people, this is seen as a way to gain access to a particular social group. An example of this is fashion
            trends wherein the increasing popularity of a certain garment or style encourages more acceptance. When individuals
            make rational choices based on the information they receive from others, economists have proposed that information
            cascades can quickly form in which people ignore their personal information signals and follow the behaviour of
            others. Cascades explain why behaviour is fragile as people understand that their behaviour is based on a very
            limited amount of information. As a result, fads form easily but are also easily dislodged. The phenomenon is
            observed in various fields, such as economics, political science, medicine, and psychology. In social psychology,
            people's tendency to align their beliefs and behaviors with a group is known as 'herd mentality' or 'groupthink'.
            The reverse bandwagon effect (also known as the snob effect in certain contexts) is a cognitive bias that causes
            people to avoid doing something, because they believe that other people are doing it.

            This effect refers to the decreased ability of people of one race to recognize faces and facial expressions of people of another race. This
            differs from the cross-race bias because this effect is found mostly during eyewitness identification as well as identification of a suspect
            in a line-up. In these situations, many people feel as if races other than their own look alike, and they have difficulty distinguishing
            between members of different ethnic groups. Cross-race identification bias is also known as the misinformation effect since people are
            considered to be misinformed about other races and have difficulty identifying them. A study was made which examined 271 real court
            cases. In photographic line-ups, 231 witnesses participated in cross-race versus same-race identification. In cross-race lineups,
            only 45% were correctly identified versus 60% for same-race identifications. In a study dealing with eyewitness testimony,
            investigators examined forty participants in a racially diverse area of the US. Participants watched a video of a property crime
            being committed, then in the next 24 hours came to pick the suspect out of a photo line-up. Most of the participants in the study
            either misidentified the suspect or stated the suspect was not in the line-up at all. Correct identification of the suspect
            occurred more often when the eyewitness and the suspect were of the same race. In another study, 86 convenience store
            clerks were asked to identify three customers: one white, one black, and one Mexican, all of whom had purchased in the store
            earlier that day. The clerks tended to identify customers belonging to their own race accurately, but were more likely to make
            errors when attempting to identify other races members. Meanwhile, another study found that "alcohol intoxication reduces
            the own-race bias in face recognition," albeit by impairing accurate perception and leaving in place or increasing random error
            rather than by improving facial recognition of members of other groups.

            The positivity effect as an attribution phenomenon relates to the habits and characteristics of people when evaluating

            behaviors.

            Two studies by Emilio Ferrara have shown that, on online social networks like Twitter and Instagram, users prefer to share

            # Mental Accounting
            Mental accounting (or psychological accounting) is a model of consumer behaviour developed by Richard Thaler that attempts to describe the
            process whereby people code, categorize and evaluate economic outcomes. Mental accounting incorporates the economic concepts of prospect
            theory and transactional utility theory to evaluate how people create distinctions between their financial resources in the form of mental
            accounts, which in turn impacts the buyer decision process and reaction to economic outcomes. People are presumed to make mental accounts
            as a self control strategy to manage and keep track of their spending and resources. People budget money into mental accounts for savings
            (e.g., saving for a home) or expense categories (e.g., gas money, clothing, utilities). People also are assumed to make mental accounts to
            facilitate savings for larger purposes (e.g., a home or college tuition). Mental accounting can result in people demonstrating greater
            loss aversion for certain mental accounts, resulting in cognitive bias that incentivizes systematic departures from consumer rationality.
            Through an increased understanding of mental accounting differences in decision making based on different resources, and different
            reactions based on similar outcomes can be greater understood.
            
            As Thaler puts it, “All organizations, from General Motors down to single person households, have explicit and/or implicit accounting
            systems. The accounting system often influences decisions in unexpected ways”.
            
            A more proximal psychological mechanism through which mental accounting influences spending is through its influence on the pain of
            paying that is associated with spending money from a mental account. Pain of paying is a negative affective response associated
            with a financial loss. Prototypical examples are the unpleasant feeling that one experiences when watching the fare increase on a
            taximeter or at the gas pump. When considering an expense, consumers appear to compare the cost of the expense to the size of an
            account that it would deplete (e.g., numerator vs. denominator). A $30 t-shirt, for example, would be a subjectively larger
            expense when drawn from $50 in one's wallet than $500 in one's checking account. The larger the fraction, the more pain of
            paying the purchase appears to generate and the less likely consumers are to then exchange money for the good. Other evidence
            of the relation between pain of paying and spending include the lower debt held by consumers who report experiencing a higher
            pain of paying for the same goods and services than consumers who report experiencing less pain of paying.

            # Normalcy Bias
            Normalcy bias, or normality bias, is a cognitive bias which leads people to disbelieve or minimize threat warnings. Consequently,
            individuals underestimate the likelihood of a disaster, when it might affect them, and its potential adverse effects. The normalcy
            bias causes many people to prepare inadequately for natural disasters, market crashes, and calamities caused by human error. About
            80% of people reportedly display normalcy bias during a disaster.
            
            The normalcy bias can manifest in response to warnings about disasters and actual catastrophes. Such events can range in scale
            from incidents such as traffic collisions to global catastrophic risk. The event may involve social constructionism phenomena
            such as loss of money in market crashes, or direct threats to continuity of life: as in natural disasters like a tsunami or
            violence in war.
            
            Normalcy bias has also been called analysis paralysis, the ostrich effect, and by first responders, the negative panic. The
            opposite of normalcy bias is overreaction, or worst-case scenario bias, in which small deviations from normality are dealt
            with as signals of an impending catastrophe.
            
            ## Prevention
            The negative effects of normalcy bias can be combated through the four stages of disaster response:
            
            - preparation, including publicly acknowledging the possibility of disaster and forming contingency plans.
            
            - warning, including issuing clear, unambiguous, and frequent warnings and helping the public to understand and believe them.
            
            - impact, the stage at which the contingency plans take effect and emergency services, rescue teams, and disaster relief
              teams work in tandem.
              
            - aftermath, reestablishing equilibrium after the fact, by providing both supplies and aid to those in need.

            # Zero-Sum Thinking & Zero-Sum Bias
            Zero-sum thinking perceives situations as zero-sum games, where one person's gain would be another's loss. The term is
            derived from game theory. However, unlike the game theory concept, zero-sum thinking refers to a psychological
            construct — a person's subjective interpretation of a situation. Zero-sum thinking is captured by the saying
            "your gain is my loss" (or conversely, "your loss is my gain").
            
            Rozycka-Tran et al. (2015) defined zero-sum thinking as:
            "A general belief system about the antagonistic nature of social relations, shared by people in a society or culture
            and based on the implicit assumption that a finite amount of goods exists in the world, in which one person's winning
            makes others the losers, and vice versa ... a relatively permanent and general conviction that social relations are
            like a zero-sum game. People who share this conviction believe that success, especially economic success, is possible
            only at the expense of other people's failures."
            
            Zero-sum bias is a cognitive bias towards zero-sum thinking; it is people's tendency to intuitively judge that a
            situation is zero-sum, even when this is not the case. This bias promotes zero-sum fallacies, false beliefs that
            situations are zero-sum. Such fallacies can cause other false judgements and poor decisions. In economics,
            "zero-sum fallacy" generally refers to the fixed-pie fallacy.
            
            ## Examples
            There are many examples of zero-sum thinking, some of them fallacious.
            
            - When jurors assume that any evidence compatible with more than one theory offers no support for any theory, even
              if the evidence is incompatible with some possibilities or the theories are not mutually exclusive.
            
            - When students in a classroom think they are being graded on a curve when in fact they are being graded based
              on predetermined standards.
            
            - In a negotiation when one negotiator thinks that they can only gain at the expense of the other party (i.e.,
              that mutual gain is not possible).
            
            - In the context of social group competition, the belief that more resources for one group (e.g., immigrants)
              means less for others (e.g., non-immigrants).
            
            - Jack of all trades, master of none: the idea that having more skills means having less aptitude (also known
              as compensatory reasoning).
            
            - In copyright infringement debate, the idea that every unauthorized duplication is a lost sale.
            
            - When politicians argue that international trade must mean that one party is "winning" and another is "losing"
              when transfer of goods and services at mutually-agreeable prices is in general mutually beneficial, or that a

            # Survivorship Bias
            Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on entities that passed a selection
            process while overlooking those that did not. This can lead to incorrect conclusions because of incomplete data.
            
            Survivorship bias is a form of selection bias that can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because multiple
            failures are overlooked, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial
            performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property,
            rather than just coincidence as in correlation "proves" causality.
            
            Another kind of survivorship bias would involve thinking that an incident happened in a particular way when
            the only people who were involved in the incident who can speak about it are those who survived it. Even if
            one knew that some people are dead, they would not have their voice to add to the conversation, making it
            biased.
            
            ## Examples
            ### Finance and Economics
            In finance, survivorship bias is the tendency for failed companies to be excluded from performance studies
            because they no longer exist. It often causes the results of studies to skew higher because only companies
            that were successful enough to survive until the end of the period are included. For example, a mutual fund
            company's selection of funds today will include only those that are successful now. Many losing funds are
            closed and merged into other funds to hide poor performance. In theory, 70% of extant funds could truthfully
            claim to have performance in the first quartile of their peers, if the peer group includes funds that have
            closed.
            
            ### Business
            Michael Shermer in Scientific American and Larry Smith of the University of Waterloo have described
            how advice about commercial success distorts perceptions of it by ignoring all of the businesses and college
            dropouts that failed. Journalist and author David McRaney observes that the "advice business is a monopoly
            run by survivors. When something becomes a non-survivor, it is either completely eliminated, or whatever
            voice it has is muted to zero". Alec Liu wrote in Vice that "for every Mark Zuckerberg, there's
            thousands of also-rans, who had parties no one ever attended, obsolete before we ever knew they
            existed."
            
            In his book The Black Swan, financial writer Nassim Taleb called the data obscured by survivorship bias
            "silent evidence".

            The denomination effect is a form of cognitive bias relating to currency, suggesting people may be
            less likely to spend larger currency denominations than their equivalent value in smaller denominations.
            It was proposed by Priya Raghubir, professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, and
            Joydeep Srivastava, professor at University of Maryland, in their 2009 paper "Denomination Effect".
            
            Raghubir and Srivastava conducted three studies in their research on the denomination effect; their
            findings suggested people may be more likely to spend money represented by smaller denominations and
            that consumers may prefer to receive money in a large denomination when there is a need to control
            spending. The denomination effect can occur when large denominations are perceived as less exchangeable
            than smaller denominations.
            
            The effect's influence on spending decisions has implications throughout various sectors in society,
            including consumer welfare, monetary policy and the finance industry. For example, during the Great
            Recession, one businessman observed employees using more coins rather than banknotes in an office
            vending machine, perceiving the customers used coins to feel thriftier. Raghubir and Srivastava
            also suggested the effect may involve incentives to alter future behavior and that a large
            denomination can serve as a mechanism to prevent the urge to spend.

            The extrinsic incentives bias is an attributional bias according to which people attribute relatively

            learning a new skill) when weighing the motives of others rather than themselves.
            
            It is a counter-example to the fundamental attribution error as according to the extrinsic bias
            others are presumed to have situational motivations while oneself is seen as having dispositional
            motivations. This is the opposite of what the fundamental attribution error would predict. It also
            might help to explain some of the backfiring effects that can occur when extrinsic incentives are
            attached to activities that people are intrinsically motivated to do. The term was first proposed
            by Chip Heath, citing earlier research by others in management science.

            In the simplest experiment Heath reported, MBA students were asked to rank the expected job motivations
            of Citibank customer service representatives. Their average ratings were as follows:
            
            1. Amount of pay
            2. Having job security

            6. Developing skills and abilities
            7. Accomplishing something worthwhile
            8. Learning new things
            
            Actual customer service representatives rank ordered their own motivations as follows:
            
            1. Developing skills and abilities
            2. Accomplishing something worthwhile
            3. Learning new things

            7. Amount of pay
            8. Amount of praise from your supervisor
            
            The order of the predicted and actual reported motivations was nearly reversed; in particular, pay was
            rated first by others but near last for respondents of themselves. Similar effects were observed when
            MBA students rated managers and their classmates.

            # Telescoping Effect
            In cognitive psychology, the telescoping effect (or telescoping bias) refers to the temporal displacement of an
            event whereby people perceive recent events as being more remote than they are and distant events as being more
            recent than they are. The former is known as backward telescoping or time expansion, and the latter as is known
            as forward telescoping.
            
            The approximate time frame in which events switch from being displaced backward in time to forward in time is three
            years, with events occurring three years in the past being equally likely to be reported with forward telescoping
            bias as with backward telescoping bias. Although telescoping occurs in both the forward and backward directions,
            in general the effect is to increase the number of events reported too recently. This net effect in the forward
            direction is because forces that impair memory, such as lack of salience, also impair time perception.
            
            Telescoping leads to an over-reporting of the frequency of events. This over-reporting is because participants
            include events beyond the period, either events that are too recent for the target time period (backward
            telescoping) or events that are too old for the target time period (forward telescoping).
            
            ## Real-world example
            A real-world example of the telescoping effect is the case of Ferdi Elsas, an infamous kidnapper and murderer
            in the Netherlands. When he was let out of prison, most of the general population did not believe he had been
            in prison long enough. Due to forward telescoping, people thought Ferdi Elsas' sentence started more recently
            than it actually did. Telescoping has important real world applications, especially in survey research. Marketing
            firms often use surveys to ask when consumers last bought a product, and government agencies often use surveys
            to discover information about drug abuse or about victimology. Telescoping may bias answers to these questions.

            amongst psychologists. Some research suggests a 'blue retrospective' which also exaggerates negative
            emotions.
            
            Though it is a cognitive bias which distorts one's view of reality, it is suggested that rosy retrospection
            serves a useful purpose in increasing self-esteem and sense of well-being. Simplifications and exaggerations
            of memories such as occur in rosy retrospection may make it easier for the brain to store long-term memories,
            as removing details may reduce the burden of those memories by requiring the generation and maintenance of
            fewer neural connections.
            
            Declinism, the predisposition to view the past more favourably and the future more negatively, may be related
            to cognitive biases like rosy retrospection. Rosy retrospection is very closely related to the concept of
            nostalgia, though the broader phenomenon of nostalgia is not usually seen as based on a biased perspective.
            
            The English idiom "rose-colored glasses" or "rose-tinted glasses" refers to perceiving something more
            positively than it is in reality. The Romans occasionally referred to this phenomenon with the Latin phrase
            "memoria praeteritorum bonorum", which translates into English roughly as "memory of good past", or more
            idiomatically as "good old days".

            ## Affective forecasting
            Affective forecasting, also known as hedonic forecasting or the hedonic forecasting mechanism, is the
            prediction of one's affect (emotional state) in the future. As a process that influences preferences,
            decisions, and behavior, affective forecasting is studied by both psychologists and economists, with
            broad applications.
            
            ## Bias
            Projection bias is the tendency to falsely project current preferences onto a future event. When people
            are trying to estimate their emotional state in the future they attempt to give an unbiased estimate.
            However, people's assessments are contaminated by their current emotional state. Thus, it may be difficult
            for them to predict their emotional state in the future, an occurrence known as mental contamination. For
            example, if a college student was currently in a negative mood because he just found out he failed a test,
            and if the college student forecasted how much he would enjoy a party two weeks later, his current negative
            mood may influence his forecast. In order to make an accurate forecast the student would need to be aware
            that his forecast is biased due to mental contamination, be motivated to correct the bias, and be able to
            correct the bias in the right direction and magnitude.
            
            Projection bias can arise from empathy gaps (or hot/cold empathy gaps), which occur when the present and
            future phases of affective forecasting are characterized by different states of physiological arousal,
            which the forecaster fails to take into account. For example, forecasters in a state of hunger are likely
            to overestimate how much they will want to eat later, overlooking the effect of their hunger on future
            preferences. As with projection bias, economists use the visceral motivations that produce empathy gaps
            to help explain impulsive or self-destructive behaviors, such as smoking.

            broad applications.
            
            ## Bias
            One of the most common sources of error in affective forecasting across various populations and situations
            is impact bias, the tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of a future event, whether in terms of
            intensity or duration. The tendencies to overestimate intensity and duration are both robust and reliable
            errors found in affective forecasting.
            
            One study documenting impact bias examined college students participating in a housing lottery. These students
            predicted how happy or unhappy they would be one year after being assigned to either a desirable or an undesirable
            dormitory. These college students predicted that the lottery outcomes would lead to meaningful differences in
            their own level of happiness, but follow-up questionnaires revealed that students assigned to desirable or
            undesirable dormitories reported nearly the same levels of happiness. Thus, differences in forecasts
            overestimated the impact of the housing assignment on future happiness.
            
            Some studies specifically address "durability bias," the tendency to overestimate the length of time future
            emotional responses will last. Even if people accurately estimate the intensity of their future emotions, they
            may not be able to estimate their duration. Durability bias is generally stronger in reaction to negative events.
            This is important because people tend to work toward events they believe will cause lasting happiness, and according
            to durability bias, people might be working toward the wrong things. Similar to impact bias, durability bias causes
            a person to overemphasize where the root cause of their happiness lies.

            innovation, that they may not see its limitations or weaknesses and continue to promote it nonetheless.
            
            Example:
            A feeling of nuclear optimism emerged in the 1950s in which it was believed that all power generators in the future
            would be atomic in nature. The atomic bomb would render all conventional explosives obsolete and nuclear power plants
            would do the same for power sources such as coal and oil. There was a general feeling that everything would use a
            nuclear power source of some sort, in a positive and productive way, from irradiating food to preserve it, to the
            development of nuclear medicine. There would be an age of peace and plenty in which atomic energy would "provide the
            power needed to desalinate water for the thirsty, irrigate the deserts for the hungry, and fuel interstellar travel
            deep into outer space". This use would render the Atomic Age as significant a step in technological progress as the

            The planning fallacy is a phenomenon in which predictions about how much time will be needed to complete a future task
            display an optimism bias and underestimate the time needed. This phenomenon sometimes occurs regardless of the individual's
            knowledge that past tasks of a similar nature have taken longer to complete than generally planned. The bias affects
            predictions only about one's own tasks. On the other hand, when outside observers predict task completion times, they
            tend to exhibit a pessimistic bias, overestimating the time needed. The planning fallacy involves estimates of task
            completion times more optimistic than those encountered in similar projects in the past.
            
            Real-world examples:

              The original cost was estimated at $7 million, but its delayed completion led to a cost of $102 million.
            
            - The Eurofighter Typhoon defense project took six years longer than expected, with an overrun cost of 8 billion euros.
            
            - The Big Dig which undergrounded the Boston Central Artery was completed seven years later than planned, for $8.08
              billion on a budget of $2.8 billion (in 1988 dollars).
            
            - The Denver International Airport opened sixteen months later than scheduled, with a total cost of $4.8 billion,
              over $2 billion more than expected.
            
            - The Berlin Brandenburg Airport is another case. After 15 years of planning, construction began in 2006, with the
              opening planned for October 2011. There were numerous delays. It was finally opened on October 31, 2020. The
              original budget was €2.83 billion; current projections are close to €10.0 billion.
            
            - Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant Unit 3 faced severe delay and a cost overrun. The construction started in 2005 and
              was expected to be completed by 2009, but completed only in 2023. Initially, the estimated cost of the project was
              around 3 billion euros, but the cost has escalated to approximately 10 billion euros.
            
            - California High-Speed Rail is still under construction, with tens of billions of dollars in overruns expected,
              and connections to major cities postponed until after completion of the rural segment.

            Hindsight bias has both positive and negative consequences. The bias also plays a role in the process of
            decision-making within the medical field.
            
            Positive consequences of hindsight bias is an increase in one's confidence and performance, as long as the bias
            distortion is reasonable and does not create overconfidence. Another positive consequence is that one's
            self-assurance of their knowledge and decision-making, even if it ends up being a poor decision, can be
            beneficial to others; allowing others to experience new things or to learn from those who made the poor
            decisions.
            
            Negative: Hindsight bias causes overconfidence in one's performance relative to others. Hindsight bias
            decreases one's rational thinking because of when a person experiences strong emotions, which in turn
            decreases rational thinking. Another negative consequence of hindsight bias is the interference of one's
            ability to learn from experience, as a person is unable to look back on past decisions and learn from
            mistakes. A third consequence is a decrease in sensitivity toward a victim by the person who caused the
            wrongdoing. The person demoralizes the victim and does not allow for a correction of behaviors and actions.
            
            Medical decision-making: Hindsight bias may lead to overconfidence and malpractice in regards to physicians.
            Hindsight bias and overconfidence is often attributed to the number of years of experience the physician has.
            After a procedure, physicians may have a "knew it the whole time" attitude, when in reality they may not have
            known it. Medical decision support systems are designed to assist physicians in diagnosis and treatment, and
            have been suggested as a way to counteract hindsight bias. However, these decision support systems come with
            drawbacks, as going against a recommended decision resulted in more punitive jury outcomes when physicians
            were found liable for causing harm.

            The less-is-better effect is a type of preference reversal that occurs when the lesser
            or smaller alternative of a proposition is preferred when evaluated separately, but not
            evaluated together.
            
            In a 1998 study, Hsee, a professor at the Graduate School of Business of The University
            of Chicago, discovered a less-is-better effect in three contexts:
            
            - (1) a person giving a $45 scarf (from scarves ranging from $5-$50) as a gift was
               perceived to be more generous than one giving a $55 coat (from coats ranging from $50-$500);
               
            - (2) an overfilled ice cream serving with 7 oz of ice cream was valued more than an underfilled
              serving with 8 oz of ice cream;
              
            - (3) a dinnerware set with 24 intact pieces was judged more favourably than one with 31 intact
              pieces (including the same 24) plus a few broken ones.
              
            Hsee noted that the less-is-better effect was observed "only when the options were evaluated 
            separately, and reversed itself when the options were juxtaposed.” Hsee explained these seemingly
            counterintuitive results “in terms of the evaluability hypothesis, which states that separate
            evaluations of objects are often influenced by attributes that are easy to evaluate rather than
            by those that are important."
            
            The less-is-better effect occurs only under specific circumstances. Evidence has shown that it
            manifests itself only when the options are evaluated individually; it disappears when they are
            assessed jointly. "If the options are put right next to each other, the effect disappears, as
            people see the true value of both," states one source. "It's just the gifts in isolation that
            give people a flipped sense of happiness and gratitude."

            # Conjunction Fallacy
            The conjunction fallacy (also known as the Linda problem) is an inference that a conjoint set of two or more
            specific conclusions is likelier than any single member of that same set, in violation of the laws of
            probability. It is a type of formal fallacy.
            
            The most often-cited example of this fallacy originated with Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman:
            
            "Linda is 31 years old, single, outspoken, and very bright. She majored in philosophy. As a student, she
            was deeply concerned with issues of discrimination and social justice, and also participated in anti-nuclear
            demonstrations."
            
            Which is more probable?
            
            - Linda is a bank teller.
            - Linda is a bank teller and is active in the feminist movement.
            
            The majority of those asked chose option 2. However, the probability of two events occurring together
            (that is, in conjunction) is always less than or equal to the probability of either one occurring itself.
            
            Tversky and Kahneman argue that most people get this problem wrong because they use a heuristic (an easily
            calculated) procedure called representativeness to make this kind of judgment: Option 2 seems more
            "representative" of Linda from the description of her, even though it is clearly mathematically less likely.
            
            ## Debiasing
            Drawing attention to set relationships, using frequencies instead of probabilities, and/or thinking
            diagrammatically (e.g. use a Venn diagram) sharply reduce the error in some forms of the conjunction
            fallacy.
            
            In one experiment the question of the Linda problem was reformulated as follows:
            
            "There are 100 persons who fit the description above (that is, Linda's). How many of them are:
            
            - Bank tellers? __ of 100
            - Bank tellers and active in the feminist movement? __ of 100"
            
            Whereas previously 85% of participants gave the wrong answer (bank teller and active in the feminist
            movement), in experiments done with this questioning the proportion of incorrect answers is dramatically
            reduced (to ~20%). Participants were forced to use a mathematical approach and thus recognized the
            difference more easily.
            
            However, in some tasks only based on frequencies, not on stories, that used clear logical formulations,
            conjunction fallacies continued to occur dominantly, with only few exceptions, when the observed pattern
            of frequencies resembled a conjunction.

            A status quo bias or default bias is a cognitive bias which results from a preference for the maintenance
            of one's existing state of affairs. The current baseline (or status quo) is taken as a reference point,
            and any change from that baseline is perceived as a loss or gain. Corresponding to different alternatives,
            this current baseline or default option is perceived and evaluated by individuals as a positive.
            
            Status quo bias should be distinguished from a rational preference for the status quo ante, as when the
            current state of affairs is objectively superior to the available alternatives, or when imperfect information
            is a significant problem. A large body of evidence, however, shows that status quo bias frequently affects
            human decision-making. Status quo bias should also be distinguished from psychological inertia, which refers
            to a lack of intervention in the current course of affairs.
            
            The bias intersects with other non-rational cognitive processes such as loss aversion, in which losses
            comparative to gains are weighed to a greater extent. Further non-rational cognitive processes include
            existence bias, endowment effect, longevity, mere exposure, and regret avoidance. Experimental evidence
            for the detection of status quo bias is seen through the use of the reversal test. A vast amount of
            experimental and field examples exist. Behaviour in regard to economics, retirement plans, health, and
            ethical choices show evidence of the status quo bias.

            the idea that individuals determine their own worth based on how they compare to others. The theory was
            developed in 1954 by psychologist Leon Festinger. This can be compared to social comparison, which is
            believed to be central to achievement motivation, feelings of injustice, depression, jealousy, and people's
            willingness to remain in relationships or jobs. The basis of the theory is that people are believed to
            compete for the best outcome in relation to their peers. For example, one might make a comparison between the
            low-end department stores they go to frequently and the designer stores of their peers. Such comparisons may
            evoke feelings of resentment, anger, and envy with their peers. This bias revolves mostly around wealth and
            social status; it is unconscious and people who make these are largely unaware of them. In most cases, people
            try to compare themselves to those in their peer group or with whom they are similar.

            # Decoy Effect
            In marketing, the decoy effect (or attraction effect or asymmetric dominance effect) is the phenomenon
            whereby consumers will tend to have a specific change in preference between two options when also presented
            with a third option that is asymmetrically dominated. An option is asymmetrically dominated when it is
            inferior in all respects to one option; but, in comparison to the other option, it is inferior in some
            respects and superior in others. In other words, in terms of specific attributes determining preferences,
            it is completely dominated by (i.e., inferior to) one option and only partially dominated by the other.
            When the asymmetrically dominated option is present, a higher percentage of consumers will prefer the
            dominating option than when the asymmetrically dominated option is absent. The asymmetrically dominated
            option is therefore a decoy serving to increase preference for the dominating option. The decoy effect
            is also an example of the violation of the independence of irrelevant alternatives axiom of decision
            theory. More simply, when deciding between two options, an unattractive third option can change the
            perceived preference between the other two.
            
            The decoy effect is considered particularly important in choice theory because it is a violation of the
            assumption of "regularity" present in all axiomatic choice models, for example in a Luce model of choice.
            Regularity means that it should not be possible for the market share of any alternative to increase when
            another alternative is added to the choice set. The new alternative should reduce, or at best leave unchanged,
            the choice share of existing alternatives. Regularity is violated in the example shown below where a new
            alternative C not only changes the relative shares of A and B but actually increases the share of A in
            absolute terms. Similarly, the introduction of a new alternative D increases the share of B in absolute
            terms.
            
            ## Example
            Suppose there is a consideration set (options to choose from in a menu) that involves smartphones. Consumers
            will generally see higher storage capacity (number of GB) and lower price as positive attributes; while some
            consumers may want a device that can store more photos, music, etc., other consumers will want a device that
            costs less. In Consideration Set 1, two devices are available:
            
            Consideration Set 1:
            - A: $400, 300GB
            - B: $300, 200GB
            
            In this case, some consumers will prefer A for its greater storage capacity, while others will prefer B for
            its lower price.
            
            Now suppose that a new player, C, the "decoy", is added to the market; it is more expensive than both A, the
            "target", and B, the "competitor", and has more storage than B but less than A:
            
            Consideration Set 2:
            - A (target): $400, 300GB
            - B (competitor): $300, 200GB
            - C (decoy): $450, 250GB
            
            The addition of decoy C — which consumers would presumably avoid, given that a lower price can be paid for a
            model with more storage—causes A, the dominating option, to be chosen more often than if only the two choices
            in Consideration Set 1 existed; C affects consumer preferences by acting as a basis of comparison for A and B.
            Because A is better than C in both respects, while B is only partially better than C, more consumers will
            prefer A now than did before. C is therefore a decoy whose sole purpose is to increase sales of A.
            
            Conversely, suppose that instead of C, a player D is introduced that has less storage than both A and B, and
            that is more expensive than B but not as expensive as A:
            
            Consideration Set 3:
            - A (competitor): $400, 300GB
            - B (target): $300, 200GB
            - D (decoy): $350, 150GB
            
            The result here is similar: consumers will not prefer D, because it is not as good as B in any respect. However,
            whereas C increased preference for A, D has the opposite effect, increasing preference for B.

            individual feels that an agent is attempting to limit one's choice of response and/or range of alternatives.
            
            Reactance can occur when someone is heavily pressured into accepting a certain view or attitude. Reactance can
            encourage an individual to adopt or strengthen a view or attitude which is indeed contrary to that which was
            intended — which is to say, to a response of noncompliance — and can also increase resistance to persuasion.
            Some individuals might employ reverse psychology in a bid to exploit reactance for their benefit, in an attempt
            to influence someone to choose the opposite of what is being requested. Reactance can occur when an individual
            senses that someone is trying to compel them to do something; often the individual will offer resistance and
            attempt to extricate themselves from the situation.

            # System Justification
            System justification theory is a theory within social psychology that system-justifying beliefs serve a psychologically
            palliative function. It proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual,
            that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous
            to certain people. People have epistemic, existential, and relational needs that are met by and manifest as ideological
            support for the prevailing structure of social, economic, and political norms. Need for order and stability, and thus
            resistance to change or alternatives, for example, can be a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good,
            legitimate, and even desirable.
            
            According to system justification theory, people desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about themselves
            (ego-justification) and the groups to which they belong (group-justification), but also to hold positive attitudes
            about the overarching social structure in which they are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification).
            This system-justifying motive sometimes produces the phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, an acceptance of inferiority
            among low-status groups and a positive image of relatively higher status groups. Thus, the notion that individuals are
            simultaneously supporters and victims of the system-instilled norms is a central idea in system justification theory.
            Additionally, the passive ease of supporting the current structure, when compared to the potential price (material,
            social, psychological) of acting out against the status quo, leads to a shared environment in which the existing social,
            economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred. Alternatives to the status quo tend to be disparaged, and
            inequality tends to perpetuate.

            object when they own it—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes
            ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value.
            For example, participants first given a pen of equal expected value to that of a coffee mug were generally unwilling

            The disposition effect is an anomaly discovered in behavioral finance. It relates to the tendency of investors to sell
            assets that have increased in value, while keeping assets that have dropped in value. Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman
            identified and named the effect in their 1985 paper, which found that people dislike losing significantly more than they
            enjoy winning. The disposition effect has been described as one of the foremost vigorous actualities around individual
            investors because investors will hold stocks that have lost value yet sell stocks that have gained value.
            
            In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky traced the cause of the disposition effect to the so-called "prospect theory".
            The prospect theory proposes that when an individual is presented with two equal choices, one having possible gains and
            the other with possible losses, the individual is more likely to opt for the former choice even though both would yield
            the same economic result.
            
            The disposition effect can be minimized by means of a mental approach called "hedonic framing". For example, individuals
            can try to force themselves to think of a single large gain as a number of smaller gains, to think of a number of smaller
            losses as a single large loss, to think of the combination of a major gain and a minor loss as a net minor gain, and, in
            the case of a combined major loss and minor gain, to think of the two separately. In a similar manner, investors show a
            reversed disposition effect when they are framed to think of their investment as progress towards a specific investment
            goal rather than a generic investment.

            Zero-risk bias is a tendency to prefer the complete elimination of risk in a sub-part over alternatives with greater
            overall risk reduction. It often manifests in cases where decision makers address problems concerning health, safety,
            and the environment. Its effect on decision making has been observed in surveys presenting hypothetical scenarios.
            
            Zero-risk bias is based on the way people feel better if a risk is eliminated instead of being merely mitigated.
            Scientists identified a zero-risk bias in responses to a questionnaire about a hypothetical cleanup scenario involving
            two hazardous sites X and Y, with X causing 8 cases of cancer annually and Y causing 4 cases annually. The respondents
            ranked three cleanup approaches: two options each reduced the total number of cancer cases by 6, while the third reduced
            the number by 5 and eliminated the cases at site Y. While the latter option featured the worst reduction overall, 42% of
            the respondents ranked it better than at least one of the other options. This conclusion resembled one from an earlier
            economics study that found people were willing to pay high costs to eliminate a risk. It has a normative justification
            since once risk is eliminated, people would have less to worry about and such removal of worry also has utility. It is

            # Loss Aversion
            In cognitive science and behavioral economics, loss aversion refers to a cognitive bias in which the same situation
            is perceived as worse if it is framed as a loss, rather than a gain. It should not be confused with risk aversion,
            which describes the rational behavior of valuing an uncertain outcome at less than its expected value.
            
            ## Application
            In marketing, the use of trial periods and rebates tries to take advantage of the buyer's tendency to value the good
            more after the buyer incorporates it in the status quo. In past behavioral economics studies, users participate up
            until the threat of loss equals any incurred gains. Methods established by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin in
            experimental economics illustrates the role of expectation, wherein an individual's belief about an outcome can
            create an instance of loss aversion, whether or not a tangible change of state has occurred.
            
            Whether a transaction is framed as a loss or as a gain is important to this calculation. The same change in price
            framed differently, for example as a $5 discount or as a $5 surcharge avoided, has a significant effect on
            consumer behavior. Although traditional economists consider this "endowment effect", and all other effects of
            loss aversion, to be completely irrational, it is important to the fields of marketing and behavioral finance.
            Users in behavioral and experimental economics studies decided to cease participation in iterative money-making
            games when the threat of loss was close to the expenditure of effort, even when the user stood to further their
            gains. Loss aversion coupled with myopia has been shown to explain macroeconomic phenomena, such as the equity
            premium puzzle. Loss aversion to kinship is an explanation for aversion to inheritance tax.

            something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
            
            Example: R&D costs. Once spent, such costs are sunk and should have no effect on future pricing decisions. So a
            pharmaceutical company's attempt to justify high prices because of the need to recoup R&D expenses is fallacious.
            The company will charge market prices whether R&D had cost one dollar or one million dollars. However, R&D costs,
            and the ability to recoup those costs, are a factor in deciding whether to spend the money on R&D. It’s important
            to distinguish that while justifying high prices on past R&D is a fallacy, raising prices in order to finance
            future R&D is not.
            
            Counterpoint: It is sometimes not that simple. In a broad range of situations, it is rational for people to condition

            person ("victim") is observed under hardship, as compared to a large, vaguely defined group with the same need.
            
            The identifiable victim effect has two components. People are more inclined to help an identified victim than an
            unidentified one, and people are more inclined to help a single identified victim than a group of identified victims.
            Although helping an identified victim may be commendable, the identifiable victim effect is considered a cognitive
            bias. From a consequentialist point of view, the cognitive error is the failure to offer N times as much help to N
            unidentified victims.
            
            The identifiable victim effect has a mirror image that is sometimes called the identifiable perpetrator effect.
            Research has shown that individuals are more inclined to mete out punishment, even at their own expense, when they
            are punishing a specific, identified perpetrator.
            
            The conceptualization of the identifiable victim effect as it is known today is commonly attributed to American
            economist Thomas Schelling. He wrote that harm to a particular person invokes "anxiety and sentiment, guilt and awe,
            responsibility and religion, [but]…most of this awesomeness disappears when we deal with statistical death".
            
            Historical figures from Joseph Stalin to Mother Teresa are credited with statements that epitomize the identifiable
            victim effect. The remark "One death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic" is widely, although probably
            incorrectly, attributed to Stalin. The remark "If I look at the mass I will never act. If I look at the one, I

            # Effort Justification
            Effort justification is an idea and paradigm in social psychology stemming from Leon Festinger's theory of cognitive
            dissonance. Effort justification is a person's tendency to attribute the value of an outcome they put effort into
            achieving as greater than the objective value of the outcome.
            
            Cognitive dissonance theory explains changes in people's attitudes or beliefs as the result of an attempt to reduce a
            dissonance (discrepancy) between contradicting ideas or cognitions. In the case of effort justification, there is a
            dissonance between the amount of effort exerted into achieving a goal or completing a task (high effort equalling high
            "cost") and the subjective reward for that effort (lower than was expected for such an effort). By adjusting and increasing
            one's attitude or subjective value of the goal, this dissonance is resolved.
            
            One of the first and most classic examples of effort justification is Aronson and Mills's study. A group of young women
            who volunteered to join a discussion group on the topic of the psychology of sex were asked to do a small reading test
            to make sure they were not too embarrassed to talk about sexual-related topics with others. The mild-embarrassment
            condition subjects were asked to read aloud a list of sex-related words such as prostitute or virgin. The
            severe-embarrassment condition subjects were asked to read aloud a list of highly sexual words (e.g. fuck, cock) and
            to read two vivid descriptions of sexual activity taken from contemporary novels. All subjects then listened to a
            recording of a discussion about sexual behavior in animals which was dull and unappealing. When asked to rate the
            group and its members, control and mild-embarrassment groups did not differ, but the severe-embarrassment group's
            ratings were significantly higher. This group, whose initiation process was more difficult (embarrassment equalling
            effort), had to increase their subjective value of the discussion group to resolve the dissonance.

            Trait ascription bias is the tendency for people to view themselves as relatively variable in terms of personality,
            behavior and mood while viewing others as much more predictable in their personal traits across different situations.
            More specifically, it is a tendency to describe one's own behaviour in terms of situational factors while preferring
            to describe another's behaviour by ascribing fixed dispositions to their personality. This may occur because peoples'
            own internal states are more readily observable and available to them than those of others.

            # Defensive Attribution Hypothesis
            The defensive attribution hypothesis (or bias, theory, or simply defensive attribution) is a social
            psychological term where an observer attributes the causes for a mishap to minimize their fear of
            being a victim or a cause in a similar situation. The attributions of blame are negatively correlated
            to similarities between the observer and the people involved in the mishap, i.e. more responsibility
            is attributed to the people involved who are dissimilar to the observer. Assigning responsibility
            allows the observer to believe that the mishap was controllable and thus preventable.
            
            A defensive attribution may also be used to protect the person's self-esteem if, despite everything,
            the mishap does occur, because blame can be assigned to the "other" (person or situation). The use of
            defensive attributions is considered a cognitive bias because an individual will change their beliefs
            about a situation based upon their motivations or desires rather than the factual characteristics of
            the situation.
            
            ## Sexual assault
            Researchers examining sexual assault have consistently found that male participants blamed rapists less
            than female participants did, and that male participants blamed the rape victims more than female
            participants did. These findings support Shaver's similarity-responsibility hypothesis: male participants,
            who are personally similar to (male) rapists, blame rapists less than female participants who are dissimilar
            to rapists. On the other hand, female participants, who are personally similar to (female) rape victims,
            blame the victims less than male participants.

            In social psychology, the fundamental attribution error (FAE) [a] is a cognitive attribution bias in which
            observers underemphasize situational and environmental factors for the behavior of an actor while overemphasizing
            dispositional or personality factors. In other words, observers tend to overattribute the behaviors of others to
            their personality (e.g., he is late because he's selfish) and underattribute them to the situation or context
            (e.g., he is late because he got stuck in traffic). Although personality traits and predispositions are considered
            to be observable facts in psychology, the fundamental attribution error is an error because it misinterprets their
            effects.
            
            The group attribution error (GAE) is identical to the fundamental attribution error, where the bias is shown between
            members of different groups rather than different individuals. The ultimate attribution error is a derivative of the
            FAE and GAE relating to the actions of groups, with an additional layer of self-justification relating to whether
            the action of an individual is representative of the wider group.

            # Illusion of Control
            The illusion of control is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events. It was named
            by U.S. psychologist Ellen Langer and is thought to influence gambling behavior and belief in the paranormal.
            
            It is the tendency for people to overestimate their ability to control events, for example, when someone feels a
            sense of control over outcomes that they demonstrably do not influence. The illusion might arise because a person
            lacks direct introspective insight into whether they are in control of events. This has been called the introspection
            illusion. Instead, they may judge their degree of control by a process which is often unreliable. As a result, they see
            themselves as responsible for events to which there is little or no causal link. For example, in one study, college
            students were in a virtual reality setting to treat a fear of heights using an elevator. Those who were told that they
            had control, yet had none, felt as though they had as much control as those who actually did have control over the
            elevator. Those who were led to believe they did not have control said they felt as though they had little control.
            
            The illusion is more common in familiar situations, and in situations where the person knows the desired outcome.
            Feedback that emphasizes success rather than failure can increase the effect, while feedback that emphasizes failure
            can decrease or reverse the effect. The illusion is weaker for depressed individuals and is stronger when individuals
            have an emotional need to control the outcome. The illusion is strengthened by stressful and competitive situations,
            including financial trading. Although people are likely to overestimate their control when the situations are heavily
            chance-determined, they also tend to underestimate their control when they actually have it, which runs contrary to
            some theories of the illusion and its adaptiveness. People also showed a higher illusion of control when they were
            allowed to become familiar with a task through practice trials, make their choice before the event happens like
            with throwing dice, and when they can make their choice rather than have it made for them with the same odds.
            People are more likely to show control when they have more answers right at the beginning than at the end,
            even when the people had the same number of correct answers.
            
            Being in a position of power enhances the illusion of control, which may lead to overreach in risk taking.

            # Actor-Observer Bias
            Actor–observer asymmetry (also actor–observer bias) is a bias one makes when forming attributions about the behavior
            of others or themselves. When people judge their own behavior, they are more likely to attribute their actions to the
            particular situation than to their personality. However, when an observer is explaining the behavior of another person,
            they are more likely to attribute this behavior to the actors' personality rather than to situational factors.
            
            Sometimes the actor–observer asymmetry is defined as the fundamental attribution error, which is when people tend to
            explain behavior on the internal, personal characteristics rather than the external factors or situational influences.
            
            The specific hypothesis of an actor–observer asymmetry in attribution was originally proposed by Edward Jones and
            Richard Nisbett, where they said that "actors tend to attribute the causes of their behavior to stimuli inherent
            in the situation, while observers tend to attribute behavior to stable dispositions of the actor". Supported by
            initial evidence, the hypothesis was long held as firmly established. However, a meta-analysis of all the published
            tests of the hypothesis between 1971 and 2004 found that there was no actor–observer asymmetry of the sort that had
            been previously proposed. The author of the study interpreted this result not so much as proof that actors and observers
            explained behavior exactly the same way but as evidence that the original hypothesis was fundamentally flawed in the way
            it framed people's explanations of behavior as attributions to either stable dispositions or the situation.
            
            Considerations of actor–observer differences can be found in other disciplines as well, such as philosophy (e.g.
            privileged access, incorrigibility), management studies, artificial intelligence, semiotics, anthropology, and
            political science.

            # Self-Serving Bias
            A self-serving bias is any cognitive or perceptual process that is distorted by the need to maintain and enhance
            self-esteem, or the tendency to perceive oneself in an overly favorable manner. It is the belief that individuals
            tend to ascribe success to their own abilities and efforts, but ascribe failure to external factors. When individuals
            reject the validity of negative feedback, focus on their strengths and achievements but overlook their faults and
            failures, or take more credit for their group's work than they give to other members, they are protecting their
            self-esteem from threat and injury. These cognitive and perceptual tendencies perpetuate illusions and error, but
            they also serve the self's need for esteem. For example, a student who attributes earning a good grade on an exam
            to their own intelligence and preparation but attributes earning a poor grade to the teacher's poor teaching ability
            or unfair test questions might be exhibiting a self-serving bias. Studies have shown that similar attributions are
            made in various situations, such as the workplace, interpersonal relationships, sports, and consumer decisions.
            
            Both motivational processes (i.e. self-enhancement, self-presentation) and cognitive processes (i.e. locus of control,
            self-esteem) influence the self-serving bias. There are both cross-cultural (i.e. individualistic and collectivistic
            culture differences) and special clinical population (i.e. depression) considerations within the bias. Much of the
            research on the self-serving bias has used participant self-reports of attribution based on experimental manipulation
            of task outcomes or in naturalistic situations. Some more modern research, however, has shifted focus to physiological
            manipulations, such as emotional inducement and neural activation, in an attempt to better understand the biological
            mechanisms that contribute to the self-serving bias.

            # Optimism Bias
            Optimism bias or optimistic bias is a cognitive bias that causes someone to believe that they themselves
            are less likely to experience a negative event. It is also known as unrealistic optimism or comparative optimism.
            
            Optimism bias is common and transcends gender, ethnicity, nationality, and age. However, autistic people are less
            susceptible to this kind of biases. Optimistic biases have also reported in other animals, such as rats and birds.
            
            Four factors can cause a person to be optimistically biased: their desired end state, their cognitive mechanisms,
            the information they have about themselves versus others, and overall mood. The optimistic bias is seen in a number
            of situations. For example: people believing that they are less at risk of being a crime victim, smokers believing
            that they are less likely to contract lung cancer or disease than other smokers, first-time bungee jumpers believing
            that they are less at risk of an injury than other jumpers, or traders who think they are less exposed to potential
            losses in the markets.
            
            Although the optimism bias occurs for both positive events (such as believing oneself to be more financially successful
            than others) and negative events (such as being less likely to have a drinking problem), there is more research and
            evidence suggesting that the bias is stronger for negative events (the valence effect). Different consequences result
            from these two types of events: positive events often lead to feelings of well being and self-esteem, while negative
            events lead to consequences involving more risk, such as engaging in risky behaviors and not taking precautionary
            measures for safety.

            Egocentric bias is the tendency to rely too heavily on one's own perspective and/or have a higher opinion of

            advantageous for memory consolidation. Research has shown that experiences, ideas, and beliefs are more easily
            recalled when they match one's own, causing an egocentric outlook. Michael Ross and Fiore Sicoly first identified
            this cognitive bias in their 1979 paper, "Egocentric Biases in Availability and Attribution". Egocentric bias is
            referred to by most psychologists as a general umbrella term under which other related phenomena fall.
            
            The effects of egocentric bias can differ based on personal characteristics, such as age and the number of
            languages one speaks. Thus far, there have been many studies focusing on specific implications of egocentric
            bias in different contexts. Research on collaborative group tasks have emphasized that people view their own

            how mental health patients display egocentric bias, and at the relationship between egocentric bias and voter
            distribution. These types of studies surrounding egocentric bias usually involve written or verbal questionnaires,

            "Hard tasks tend to produce overconfidence but worse-than-average perceptions," reported Katherine A. Burson,

            people to "see their own behavioral choices and judgments as relatively common and appropriate to existing
            circumstances". In other words, they assume that their personal qualities, characteristics, beliefs, and actions
            are relatively widespread through the general population.
            
            This false consensus is significant because it increases self-esteem (overconfidence effect). It can be derived from
            a desire to conform and be liked by others in a social environment. This bias is especially prevalent in group
            settings where one thinks the collective opinion of their own group matches that of the larger population. Since
            the members of a group reach a consensus and rarely encounter those who dispute it, they tend to believe that
            everybody thinks the same way. The false-consensus effect is not restricted to cases where people believe that
            their values are shared by the majority, but it still manifests as an overestimate of the extent of their belief.
            
            Additionally, when confronted with evidence that a consensus does not exist, people often assume that those who
            do not agree with them are defective in some way. There is no single cause for this cognitive bias; the
            availability heuristic, self-serving bias, and naïve realism have been suggested as at least partial underlying
            factors. The bias may also result, at least in part, from non-social stimulus-reward associations. Maintenance
            of this cognitive bias may be related to the tendency to make decisions with relatively little information.
            When faced with uncertainty and a limited sample from which to make decisions, people often "project"
            themselves onto the situation. When this personal knowledge is used as input to make generalizations,
            it often results in the false sense of being part of the majority.

            # Third-Person Effect
            The third-person effect hypothesis predicts that people tend to perceive that mass media messages have a greater
            effect on others than on themselves, based on personal biases. The third-person effect manifests itself through
            an individual's overestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on the generalized other, or an
            underestimation of the effect of a mass communicated message on themselves.
            
            These types of perceptions stem from a self-motivated social desirability (not feeling influenced by mass messages
            promotes self-esteem), a social-distance corollary (choosing to dissociate oneself from the others who may be
            influenced), and a perceived exposure to a message (others choose to be influenced by persuasive communication).
            Other names for the effect are "Third-person perception" and "Web Third-person effect". From 2015, the effect is
            named "Web Third-person effect" when it is verified in social media, media websites, blogs and in websites in general.

            # Social-Desirability Bias
            In social science research, social-desirability bias is a type of response bias that is the tendency of survey
            respondents to answer questions in a manner that will be viewed favorably by others. It can take the form of
            over-reporting "good behavior" or under-reporting "bad", or undesirable behavior. The tendency poses a serious
            problem with conducting research with self-reports. This bias interferes with the interpretation of average
            tendencies as well as individual differences.
            
            Topics where socially desirable responding (SDR) is of special concern are self-reports of abilities, personality,
            sexual behavior, and drug use. When confronted with the question "How often do you masturbate?," for example,
            respondents may be pressured by a social taboo against masturbation, and either under-report the frequency or
            avoid answering the question. Therefore, the mean rates of masturbation derived from self-report surveys are
            likely to be severely underestimated.
            
            When confronted with the question, "Do you use drugs/illicit substances?" the respondent may be influenced by
            the fact that controlled substances, including the more commonly used marijuana, are generally illegal.
            Respondents may feel pressured to deny any drug use or rationalize it, e.g. "I only smoke marijuana when my
            friends are around." The bias can also influence reports of number of sexual partners. In fact, the bias
            may operate in opposite directions for different subgroups: Whereas men tend to inflate the numbers, women
            tend to underestimate theirs. In either case, the mean reports from both groups are likely to be distorted
            by social desirability bias.
            
            Other topics that are sensitive to social-desirability bias include:
            
            - Self-reported personality traits will correlate strongly with social desirability bias
            - Personal income and earnings, often inflated when low and deflated when high
            - Feelings of low self-worth and/or powerlessness, often denied
            - Excretory functions, often approached uncomfortably, if discussed at all
            - Compliance with medicinal-dosing schedules, often inflated
            - Family planning, including use of contraceptives and abortion
            - Religion, often either avoided or uncomfortably approached
            - Patriotism, either inflated or, if denied, done so with a fear of other party's judgment
            - Bigotry and intolerance, often denied, even if it exists within the responder
            - Intellectual achievements, often inflated
            - Physical appearance, either inflated or deflated
            - Acts of real or imagined physical violence, often denied
            - Indicators of charity or "benevolence," often inflated
            - Illegal acts, often denied
            - Voter turnout
