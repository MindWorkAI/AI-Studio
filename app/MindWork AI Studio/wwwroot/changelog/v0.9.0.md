- Upgraded `keyring` dependency to v3.2.0.
- Refactored the interprocess communication (IPC) to use a new runtime API for better performance, stability, extensibility, maintainability, and security. This is the foundation for upcoming features and improvements, such as performant RAG and scripting support.
- Refactored the logging system. Now, the logging of all systems is unified.
