# v0.9.25, build 200 (2025-01-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Improved the stop generation button behavior to ensure that the AI stops generating content immediately (which will save compute time, energy and financial resources).
- Restructured the streaming network code to be centralized out of the individual providers. This will allow for easier maintenance and updates in the future.
