# v0.9.25, build 200 (2025-01-04 18:33 UTC)
- Added xAI as a new provider. xAI provides their Grok models for generating content.
- Improved the stop generation button behavior to ensure that the AI stops generating content immediately (which will save compute time, energy and financial resources).
- Fixed the chat scrolling behavior after toggling the workspaces.
- Fixed an issue when loading the today's bias chat, triggered by the bias assistant.
- Restructured the streaming network code to be centralized out of the individual providers. This will allow for easier maintenance and updates in the future.
