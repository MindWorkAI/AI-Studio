# v0.9.41, build 216 (2025-0x-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the user-language, as provided by the OS, to the about page. This helps in identifying user-specific issues related to language settings.
- Changed the terminology from "temporary chats" to "disappearing chats" in the UI. This makes it clearer to understand the purpose of these chats.
- Improved the hot reloading of the plugin system to prevent overlapping reloads.
- Improved the app behavior when the user system was waked up from sleep mode.
- Fixed the color for the update notification button to match the color theme.
