# v0.9.23, build 198 (2024-12-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added an ERI server coding assistant as a preview feature behind the RAG feature flag. This helps you implement an ERI server to gain access to, e.g., your enterprise data from within AI Studio.
- Improved provider requests by handling rate limits by retrying requests. 
- Improved the creation of the "the bias of the day" workspace; create that workspace only when the bias of the day feature is used.
- Fixed layout issues when selecting `other` items (e.g., programming languages).
- Fixed a bug about the bias of the day workspace when the workspace component was hidden.
