- Improved the experience of the data selection component when no data sources are configured yet.
- Improved the data source selection behavior when no data source is available or selected, for whatever reason.
- Moved the data source settings into the data selection component.
- Fixed the "send to" menu position, which was offset due to the MudBlazor 8 upgrade.
- Fixed a rare issue with the enum selection component, where the `SelectionUpdated` function was not called for the special `other` enum values.
- Fixed the new setting dialogs, which were not updated appropriately when settings were changed.
- Removed the link to the ERI server assistant from its settings page, as it is no longer necessary.
