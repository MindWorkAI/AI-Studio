# v0.9.40, build 215 (2025-04-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added support for the announced OpenAI `o4` models. We hope that these `o4` models will be usable by the well-known chat completion API instead of the new responses API, though. AI Studio cannot use the new responses API right now.
- Added Alibaba Cloud as a new provider.
- Improved the provider selection by showing the name of the provider in the provider selection instead of its identifier.
- Fixed an issue where OpenAI `o3` models were not shown in the model selection.
