# v26.1.2, build 232 (2026-01-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the option to hide specific assistants by configuration plugins. This is useful for enterprise environments in organizations.
- Fixed a logging bug that prevented log events from being recorded in some cases.
- Fixed a bug affecting the transcription preview: previously, when you stopped music or other media, recorded or dictated text, and then tried to resume playback, the media wouldn’t resume as expected. This behavior is now fixed.
