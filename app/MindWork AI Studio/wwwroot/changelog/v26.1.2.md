# v26.1.2, build 232 (2026-01-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the option to hide specific assistants by configuration plugins. This is useful for enterprise environments in organizations.
- Added the current date and time to the system prompt for better context in conversations. Thanks Peer `peerschuett` for the contribution.
- Added the ability to control the voice recording with transcription (in preview) by using a system-wide shortcut. The shortcut can be configured in the application settings or by using a configuration plugin. Thus, a uniform shortcut can be defined for an entire organization.
- Added error handling for the context window overflow, which can occur with huge file attachments in chats or the document analysis assistant.
- Added Rust failure detection to the .NET server. This is helpful in order to handle critical failures and shut down the application gracefully.
- Improved the error handling for model loading in provider dialogs (LLMs, embeddings, transcriptions).
- Improved the microphone handling (transcription preview) so that all sound effects and the voice recording are processed without interruption.
- Improved the handling of self-hosted providers in the configuration dialogs (LLMs, embeddings, and transcriptions) when the host cannot provide a list of models.
- Improved the document analysis assistant (in preview) by allowing users to send results to a new chat to ask follow-up questions. Thanks to Sabrina `Sabrina-devops` for this contribution.
- Improved the developer experience by detecting incorrect CPU architecture metadata when checking and installing the Pandoc dependency.
- Improved the error messages for failed communication with AI servers.
- Improved the error handling for the enterprise environment service regarding the communication with our Rust layer.
- Fixed a logging bug that prevented log events from being recorded in some cases.
- Fixed a bug that allowed adding a provider (LLM, embedding, or transcription) without selecting a model.
- Fixed a bug with local transcription providers by handling errors correctly when the local provider is unavailable.
- Fixed a bug with local transcription providers by correctly handling empty model IDs.
- Fixed a bug affecting the transcription preview: previously, when you stopped music or other media, recorded or dictated text, and then tried to resume playback, the media wouldn’t resume as expected. This behavior is now fixed.
- Fixed a rare bug that occurred when multiple threads tried to manage the same chat thread.
- Fixed a bug that prevented text localization from certain source code files under specific conditions.
