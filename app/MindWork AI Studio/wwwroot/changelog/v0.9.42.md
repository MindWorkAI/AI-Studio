# v0.9.42, build 217 (2025-05-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Improved the model selection for OpenAI by removing all `o1-pro` models. These models cannot be used right now, since OpenAI introduced a new API, which is not yet supported by MindWork AI Studio.
- Fixed an issue where empty lines in source code were being ignored by the Markdown renderer. Thanks My Nihongo for fixing this bug in the `MudBlazor.Markdown` repository.
- Fixed the localization assistant not being able to load the localization file when used in the release app.
- Upgraded .NET dependencies.
