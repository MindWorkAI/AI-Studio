# v0.9.55, build 230 (2025-12-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added support for newer Mistral models (Mistral 3, Voxtral, and Magistral).
- Added a description field to local data sources (preview feature) so that the data selection agent has more information about which data each local source contains when selecting data sources.
- Improved the document analysis assistant (in preview) by adding descriptions to the different sections.
- Improved the document preview dialog for the document analysis assistant (in preview), providing Markdown and plain text views for attached files.
- Improved the ID handling for configuration plugins.
- Fixed a bug in the local data sources info dialog (preview feature) for data directories that could cause the app to crash. The error was caused by a background thread producing data while the frontend attempted to display it.
