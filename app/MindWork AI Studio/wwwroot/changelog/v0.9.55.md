# v0.9.55, build 230 (2025-12-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added support for newer Mistral models (Mistral 3, Voxtral, and Magistral).
- Added support for the new OpenAI model GPT 5.2.
- Added support for OpenRouter as LLM and embedding provider.
- Added a description field to local data sources (preview feature) so that the data selection agent has more information about which data each local source contains when selecting data sources.
- Added the ability to use file attachments in chat. This is the initial implementation of this feature. We will continue to develop this feature and refine it further based on user feedback. Many thanks to Sabrina `Sabrina-devops` for this wonderful contribution.
- Improved the document analysis assistant (in preview) by adding descriptions to the different sections.
- Improved the document preview dialog for the document analysis assistant (in preview), providing Markdown and plain text views for attached files.
- Improved the Pandoc handling for the document analysis assistant (in preview) and file attachments in chat. When Pandoc is not installed and users attempt to attach files, users are now prompted to install Pandoc first.
- Improved the ID handling for configuration plugins.
- Improved error handling, logging, and code quality.
- Improved error handling for Microsoft Word export.
- Improved file reading, e.g. for the translation, summarization, and legal assistants, by performing the Pandoc validation in the first step. This prevents unnecessary selection of files that cannot be processed.
- Improved the file selection for file attachments in chat and assistant file loading by filtering out audio files. Audio attachments are not yet supported.
- Fixed a bug in the local data sources info dialog (preview feature) for data directories that could cause the app to crash. The error was caused by a background thread producing data while the frontend attempted to display it.
- Fixed a visual bug where a function's preview status was misaligned. You might have seen it in document analysis or the ERI server assistant.
- Fixed a rare bug in the Microsoft Word export for huge documents.
- Upgraded dependencies such as Rust, MudBlazor, and others.
