# v0.9.10, build 185 (2024-09-12 20:52 UTC)
- Added support for OpenAI's `o1` models. The `01` models presented today are initially limited to tier 5 accounts. This means that only individuals who have invested at least $1,000 in the OpenAI API and whose account is at least 30 days old can see and use `01` models. Once your OpenAI account has been activated for the new `o1` models, you can select these models from the model list in the provider settings.
- Added another source link for the OpenAI's confidence card.
