# v26.2.1, build 233 (2026-02-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the ability to individually configure the minimum confidence level, standard profile, and default provider for each policy in the Document Analysis Assistant (in preview).
- Added support for defining document analysis policies (in preview) by configuration plugins, enabling centralized management of policies across entire departments or organizations.
- Added an option to hide the policy definition in the Document Analysis Assistant (in preview) when exporting and distributing that policy by a configuration plugin in organizations, making it easier for users to use.
- Added the policy export functionality to the Document Analysis Assistant (in preview). You can now export policies as Lua code for a configuration plugin to distribute the policy across your organization.
- Improved the error checking & logging behavior when the installed `PDFium` version did not meet the minimum required version.
- Improved the logging behavior when parsing profile tables from configuration plugins.
- Fixed a bug where the global minimum confidence level was not being applied to the assistants.
- Upgraded the Document Analysis Assistant and the voice recording with transcription feature (both in preview) from the prototype to the beta state. Both features are now completely implemented and are undergoing a deeper testing phase in preparation for release.
