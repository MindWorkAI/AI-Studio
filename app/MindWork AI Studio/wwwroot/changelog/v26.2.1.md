- Added support for defining document analysis policies (in preview) by configuration plugins, enabling centralized management of policies across entire departments or organizations.
- Added an option to hide the policy definition in the Document Analysis Assistant (in preview) when exporting and distributing that policy by a configuration plugin in organizations, making it easier for users to use.
- Added the policy export functionality to the Document Analysis Assistant (in preview). You can now export policies as Lua code for a configuration plugin to distribute the policy across your organization.
- Fixed a bug where the global minimum confidence level was not being applied to the assistants.
