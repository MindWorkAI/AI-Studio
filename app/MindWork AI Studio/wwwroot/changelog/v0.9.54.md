# v0.9.54, build 229 (2025-11-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added a preview of the document analysis. Documents can now be uploaded and analyzed according to predefined rules. Structured output can also be configured using corresponding rules. This preview must be explicitly enabled in the app settings; otherwise, it remains hidden. Thanks, Peer (`peerschuett`), for your support.
