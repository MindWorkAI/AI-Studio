# v0.9.46, build 221 (2025-06-01 19:19 UTC)
- We just finished the first version of our plugin system. Right now, there are language plugins to help localize AI Studio and configuration plugins for enterprise environments. In the future, you’ll also be able to develop custom assistants as plugins. Languages and assistants will be available in public repositories, and AI Studio will have an app-store-like view for easy access. We’re proud to have set the foundation with this version.
- Completed the I18N system and made all 1,856 AI Studio text contents localizable.
- AI Studio comes with two standard plugins: one for English (US) and one for German (Germany). When you start AI Studio, it tries to pick the language set on your operating system. If your language isn't supported yet, it uses English instead.
- Added the ability to configure the maximum number of results returned per request for all data sources. Please note that this feature remains in preview and is not visible to all users.
- Added the Pandoc integration, which enables us to use Pandoc for data processing (e.g., RAG) and for generating files (e.g., Office documents). We thank Nils `nilskruthoff` for the excellent contribution.
