- Added the ability to configure the maximum number of results returned per request for all data sources. Please note that this feature remains in preview and is not visible to all users.
- Added more text content to the I18N system & added the German translation for it.
- Added the Pandoc integration, which enables us to use Pandoc for data processing (e.g., RAG) and for generating files (e.g., Office documents). We thank Nils `nilskruthoff` for the excellent contribution.
