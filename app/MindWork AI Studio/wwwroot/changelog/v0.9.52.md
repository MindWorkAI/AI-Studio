# v0.9.52, build 227 (2025-09-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added a feature so that matching results from data sources (local data sources as well as external ones via the ERI interface) are now also displayed at the end of a chat. All sources that come directly from the AI (like web searches) appear first, followed by those that come from the data sources. This source display works regardless of whether the AI actually used these sources, so users always get all the relevant information.
- Improved developer experience by detecting development environments and disabling update prompts in those environments.
- Fixed an issue where external data sources using the ERI interface weren't using the correct source names during the augmentation phase.
