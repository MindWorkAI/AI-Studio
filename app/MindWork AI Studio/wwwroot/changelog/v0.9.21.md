# v0.9.21, build 196 (2024-11-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added: Chats remember which LLM provider was used. This is useful to continue exactly where you left off.
- Added options for how to decide which LLM provider should be chosen when creating new chats and when loading chats. When you want the previous behavior restored (always use the default chat provider), you can configure this behavior as well.
- Fixed the missed workspace title when loading the today's bias.
- Fixed auto-save when sending assistant results to a new chat.
