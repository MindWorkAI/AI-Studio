# v26.1.1, build 231 (2026-01-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the option to attach files, including images, to chat templates. You can also define templates with file attachments through a configuration plugin. These file attachments aren’t copied—they’re re-read every time. That means the AI will pick up any updates you make to those files.
- Added the option to use source code files in chats and document analysis. This supports software development workflows.
- Added a preview feature that lets you record your own voice for transcription. The feature remains in development and appears only when the preview feature is enabled.
- Added the option to configure transcription providers (for example, using Whisper models). As usual, there can be local as well as cloud models configured. This option is part of the transcription preview and remains hidden until the preview is activated or the feature gets released.
- Added an option to the app settings to select a provider for transcribing dictated text. If no provider is selected, dictation and text transcription are disabled.
- Improved the app versioning. Starting in 2026, each version number includes the year, followed by the month. The last digit shows the release number for that month. For example, version `26.1.1` is the first release in January 2026.
- Fixed a bug in the profile selection where the "Use no profile" entry could not be localized, causing English text to appear in languages such as German. This behavior has now been fixed.
