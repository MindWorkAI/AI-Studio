# v26.1.1, build 231 (2026-01-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added the option to attach files, including images, to chat templates. You can also define templates with file attachments through a configuration plugin. These file attachments aren’t copied—they’re re-read every time. That means the AI will pick up any updates you make to those files.
- Improved the app versioning. Starting in 2026, each version number includes the year, followed by the month. The last digit shows the release number for that month. For example, version `26.1.1` is the first release in January 2026.
