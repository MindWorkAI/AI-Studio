# v0.9.45, build 220 (2025-05-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added chat templates. They are similar to common AI companies' playgrounds, where you can define your own system prompts and leverage assistant prompts for providers that support them. We thank Peer `peerschuett` for the work on this feature.
- Added Russian as a language option for various assistants (e.g., translations, text summarization).
- Improved chat options: you can access them directly from the chat interface.
- Changed the design of the data source settings to match the new design.
