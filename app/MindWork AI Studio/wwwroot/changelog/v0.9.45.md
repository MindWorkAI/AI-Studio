# v0.9.45, build 220 (2025-05-25 13:56 UTC)
- Added chat templates. They are similar to common AI companies' playgrounds, where you can define your own system prompts and leverage assistant prompts for providers that support them. We thank Peer `peerschuett` for the work on this feature.
- Added Russian as a language option for various assistants (e.g., translations, text summarization).
- Improved the password and API key input fields: they now optionally display their content to allow users to verify manual input.
- Improved the Anthropic provider by adding aliase and capabilities for the new Claude 4 models.
- Improved the German translation.
- Changed the design of the data source settings to match the new design.
- Moved the chat options: you can access them directly from the chat interface.
- Moved the profile settings to the profile selection: this allows you to manage your profiles directly from where you use them.
- Moved the workspace settings directly to the workspaces so you can configure them directly there.
