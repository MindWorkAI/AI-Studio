# v0.9.45, build 220 (2025-05-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added chat templates. They are similar to common AI companies' playgrounds, where you can define your own system prompts and leverage assistant prompts for providers that support them. We thank Peer `peerschuett` for the work on this feature.
- Added Russian as a language option for various assistants (e.g., translations, text summarization).
- Improved chat options: you can access them directly from the chat interface.
- Improved password and API key input fields: they now optionally display their content to allow users to verify manual input.
- Changed the design of the data source settings to match the new design.
- Moved the profile settings to the profile selection: this allows you to manage your profiles directly from where you use them.
