# v26.2.2, build 234 (2026-02-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added a vector database (Qdrant) as a building block for our local RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) solution. Thank you very much, Paul (`PaulKoudelka`), for this major contribution. Note that our local RAG implementation remained in preview and has not yet been released; other building blocks are not yet ready.
- Added an app setting to enable administration options for IT staff to configure and maintain organization-wide settings.
- Added an option to export all provider types (LLMs, embeddings, transcriptions) so you can use them in a configuration plugin. You'll be asked if you want to export the related API key too. API keys will be encrypted in the export. This feature only shows up when administration options are enabled.
- Added an option in the app settings to create an encryption secret, which is required to encrypt values (for example, API keys) in configuration plugins. This feature only shows up when administration options are enabled.
- Improved the document analysis assistant (in beta) by hiding the export functionality by default. Enable the administration options in the app settings to show and use the export functionality. This streamlines the usage for regular users.
- Improved the workspaces experience by using a different color for the delete button to avoid confusion.
- Upgraded dependencies.
