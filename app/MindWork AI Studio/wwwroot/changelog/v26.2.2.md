# v26.2.2, build 234 (2026-02-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added a vector database (Qdrant) as a building block for our local RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) solution. Thank you very much, Paul (`PaulKoudelka`), for this major contribution. Note that our local RAG implementation remained in preview and has not yet been released; other building blocks are not yet ready.
- Added an app setting to enable administration options for IT staff to configure and maintain organization-wide settings.
- Added an option to export all provider types (LLMs, embeddings, transcriptions) for use in a configuration plugin. This feature appears only when administration options are enabled.
- Improved the document analysis assistant (in beta) by hiding the export functionality by default. Enable the administration options in the app settings to show and use the export functionality. This streamlines the usage for regular users.
