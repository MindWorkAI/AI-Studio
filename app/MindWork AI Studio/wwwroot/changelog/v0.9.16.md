# v0.9.16, build 191 (2024-11-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added our second financial contributor: Thanks `peerschuett` for supporting AI Studio financially.
- Added multiple workspace display options: toggle the workspace overlay (this is the previous behavior), toggle the workspace sidebar, or permanently display the workspace sidebar.
- Improved the layout of the app window, for example, in full-screen mode on large or high-resolution monitors.
- Fixed the "send to" issue, where you could select the bias-of-the-day assistant as destination.
- Fixed the appearance of the "no diff" message for text diffs when the dark mode is enabled.
