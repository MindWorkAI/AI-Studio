# v0.9.22, build 197 (2024-12-04 10:58 UTC)
- Added the possibility to configure preview feature visibility in the app settings. This is useful for users who want to test new features before they are officially released.
- Added the possibility to configure embedding providers in the app settings as a prototype preview feature. Embeddings are necessary in order to integrate local data and files.
- Added the writer mode as an experimental preview feature. This feature is just an experiment as we explore how to implement long text support in AI Studio.
- Improved self-hosted LLM provider configuration by filtering embedding models.
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't move a chat to (another) workspace when the workspaces were docked to the left side and were collapsed.
- Fixed a bug when you replaced a chat with a new chat, and the workspaces were docked to the left and were collapsed; then, the previous chat was not removed from the workspace.
