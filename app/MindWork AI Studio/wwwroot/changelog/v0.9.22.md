- Added the possibility to configure preview feature visibility in the app settings. This is useful for users who want to test new features before they are officially released.
- Added the possibility to configure embedding providers in the app settings as a prototype preview feature. Embeddings are necessary in order to integrate local data and files.

- Improved self-hosted LLM provider configuration by filtering embedding models.
