# v0.9.39, build 214 (2025-03-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added a feature flag for the plugin system. This flag is disabled by default and can be enabled inside the app settings. Please note that this feature is still in development; there are no plugins available yet.
- Added the Lua library we use for the plugin system to the about page.
- Added the plugin overview page. This page shows all installed plugins and allows you to enable or disable them. It is only available when the plugin preview feature is enabled.
- Fixed the preview tooltip component not showing the correct position when used inside a scrollable container.
- Upgraded to Rust 1.85.1
