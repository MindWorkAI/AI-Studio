# v0.9.39, build 214 (2025-04-xx xx:xx UTC)
- Added UI for error handling to display any LLM provider issues.
- Added a feature flag for the plugin system. This flag is disabled by default and can be enabled inside the app settings. Please note that this feature is still in development; there are no plugins available yet.
- Added the Lua library we use for the plugin system to the about page.
- Added the plugin overview page. This page shows all installed plugins and allows you to enable or disable them. It is only available when the plugin preview feature is enabled.
- Added hot reloading for plugins. When any plugin is changed, the app will automatically reload the plugin without needing to restart the app.
- Added an API for streaming arbitrary local files to the embedding process. Thanks Nils `nilskruthoff` for this great contribution.
- Changed the update notification to use the default notification system at the bottom instead of the custom alert bar at the top.
- Fixed the preview tooltip component not showing the correct position when used inside a scrollable container.
- Upgraded to Rust v1.86.0
- Upgraded to MudBlazor v8.5.1
