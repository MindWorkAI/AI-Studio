# v0.9.7, build 182 (2024-09-08 20:55 UTC)
- Added the possibility to define multiple profiles in the settings. Use profiles to share some information about you with the AI.
- Added profiles to the chat interface. You can now select a profile for each chat or even change the profile during a chat.
- Added profiles to some assistants. It makes no sense to have profiles for, e.g., translation, etc.
- Added the possibility to preselect any of your profiles as the default profile for the entire app or configure individual profiles for assistants and chats. 
- Added an introductory description to the provider settings.
- Added an indicator for the current and maximal length of the provider instance name.
- Fixed the annoying bug that input made in the chat interface was not cleared when sending the message using hotkeys.
- Fixed the bug that the model name for Fireworks was not loaded when editing the provider settings.
- Fixed a bug where it was possible that the chat interface was not scrolling to the bottom when new messages were added.
- Improved hyphenation for continuous text so that the rules of the respective language are taken into account where possible.
- Improved the rules for provider names: unnecessary restrictions from earlier versions have been removed. You can now use emojis in your provider names when you like.
