# MindWork AI Studio

## News
Things we are currently working on:

- Since November 2024: Work on RAG (integration of your data and files) has begun. We will support the integration of local and external data sources. We need to implement the following runtime (Rust) and app (.NET) steps:

  - [x] ~~Runtime: Restructuring the code into meaningful modules (PR [#192](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/192))~~
  - [x] ~~Define the [External Data API (EDI)](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/EDI) as a contract for integrating arbitrary external data (PR [#1](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/EDI/pull/1))~~
  - [x] ~~App: Metadata for providers (which provider offers embeddings?) (PR [#205](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/205))~~
  - [x] ~~App: Add an option to show preview features (PR [#222](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/222))~~
  - [x] ~~App: Configure embedding providers (PR [#224](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/224))~~
  - [ ] App: Management of data sources (local & external data via [EDI](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/EDI))
  - [ ] Runtime: Extract data from txt / md / pdf / docx / xlsx files
  - [ ] (*Optional*) Runtime: Implement internal embedding provider through [fastembed-rs](https://github.com/Anush008/fastembed-rs)
  - [ ] App: Implement external embedding providers
  - [ ] App: Implement the process to vectorize one local file using embeddings
  - [ ] Runtime: Integration of the vector database [LanceDB](https://github.com/lancedb/lancedb)
  - [ ] App: Implement the continuous process of vectorizing data
  - [ ] App: Define a common retrieval context interface for the integration of RAG processes in chats
  - [ ] App: Define a common augmentation interface for the integration of RAG processes in chats
  - [ ] App: Integrate data sources in chats


- Since September 2024: Experiments have been started on how we can work on long texts with AI Studio. Let's say you want to write a fantasy novel or create a complex project proposal and use LLM for support. The initial experiments were promising, but not yet satisfactory. We are testing further approaches until a satisfactory solution is found. The current state of our experiment is available as an experimental preview feature through your app configuration.

Other News:

- October 2024: We've found the first two financial supporters. Huge thanks to `richard-stanton` and `peerschuett` for backing the project. Thanks for having the courage to be the first to support us.

- October 2024: The [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Aerospace_Center) ([Website](https://www.dlr.de/en)) will use AI Studio at least within the scope of one project and will also contribute to its further development. This is great news.


Features we have recently released:

- v0.9.22: Added options for preview features; added embedding provider configuration for RAG (preview) and writer mode (experimental preview).
- v0.9.18: Added the new Anthropic Heiku model; added Groq and Google Gemini as provider options.
- v0.9.17: Added the new Anthropic model `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`.
- v0.9.16: Added workspace display options & improved the layout of the app window.
- v0.9.15: Added the bias-of-the-day assistant. Tells you about a cognitive bias every day.
- v0.9.13: You can use `ollama` providers secured with API keys.
- v0.9.12: Added a job posting assistant to the business category and improved grammar & spelling check and rewrite assistants.
- v0.9.11: Added enforcement of minimal confidence levels & dark mode.

## What is AI Studio?

MindWork AI Studio is a desktop application available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides a unified chat interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). You bring your own API key for the respective LLM provider to use the models. The API keys are securely stored by the operating system.

**Key advantages:**
- **Free of charge**: The app is free to use, both for personal and commercial purposes.
- **Independence**: You are not tied to any single provider. Instead, you can choose the provider that best suits their needs. Right now, we support OpenAI (GPT4o etc.), Mistral, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, and self-hosted models using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [Groq](https://groq.com/), or [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/).
- **Unrestricted usage**: Unlike services like ChatGPT, which impose limits after intensive use, MindWork AI Studio offers unlimited usage through the providers API.
- **Cost-effective**: You only pay for what you use, which can be cheaper than monthly subscription services like ChatGPT Plus, especially if used infrequently. But beware, here be dragons: For extremely intensive usage, the API costs can be significantly higher. Unfortunately, providers currently do not offer a way to display current costs in the app. Therefore, check your account with the respective provider to see how your costs are developing. When available, use prepaid and set a cost limit.
- **Privacy**: The data entered into the app is not used for training by the providers since we are using the provider's API.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the provider and model best suited for your current task.
- **No bloatware**: The app requires minimal storage for installation and operates with low memory usage. Additionally, it has a minimal impact on system resources, which is beneficial for battery life.

## Planned Features
Here's an exciting look at some of the features we're planning to add to AI Studio in future releases:
- **Integrating your data**: You should be able to integrate your data into AI Studio. For example, your PDF or Office files, or your Markdown notes.
- **Integration of enterprise data:** Soon, it will also be possible to integrate data from the corporate network using an interface that we have specified ([External Data API](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/EDI), EDI for short).
- **Writing mode:** We want to integrate a writing mode that should support you in creating extensive works. We are thinking of comprehensive project proposals, tenders, or your next fantasy novel.
- **Browser usage:** We're trying to offer the features from AI Studio to you in the browser via a plugin, so we could use spell-checking or rewriting text directly in the browser.
- **Voice control:** You should be able to interact with the AI systems using your voice as well. To achieve this, we want to integrate voice input (speech-to-text) and output (text-to-speech). However, later on, it should also have a natural conversation flow, i.e., seamless conversation.
- **Email monitoring:** You should have the option to connect your email inboxes with AI Studio. The AI reads your emails and sends you a notification when something important happens. At the same time, you can access knowledge from your emails in your chats.

Stay tuned for more updates and enhancements to make MindWork AI Studio even more powerful and versatile ü§©.
