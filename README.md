# MindWork AI Studio
MindWork AI Studio is a desktop application available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides a unified chat interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). You bring your own API key for the respective LLM provider to use the models. The API keys are securely stored by the operating system.

**Key advantages:**
- **Free of charge**: The app is free to use, both for personal and commercial purposes.
- **Independence**: Users are not tied to any single provider. The initial version supports OpenAI models (like GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, etc.). Future versions will support other providers such as Mistral or Google Gemini.
- **Unrestricted usage**: Unlike services like ChatGPT, which impose limits after intensive use, MindWork AI Studio offers unlimited usage through the providers API.
- **Cost-effective**: You only pay for what you use, which can be cheaper than monthly subscription services like ChatGPT Plus, especially if used infrequently. But beware, here be dragons: For extremely intensive usage, the API costs can be significantly higher. Unfortunately, providers currently do not offer a way to display current costs in the app. Therefore, check your account with the respective provider to see how your costs are developing. When available, use prepaid and set a cost limit.
- **Privacy**: The data entered into the app is not used for training by the providers since we are using the provider's API.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the provider and model best suited for your current task.
- **No bloatware**: The app requires minimal storage for installation and operates with low memory usage. Additionally, it has a minimal impact on system resources, which is beneficial for battery life.

- **Local LLMs**: We aim to support local LLMs, enabling you to use options like LM Studio, `ollama`, or `llama.cpp` for a more private and self-contained experience.
- **System prompts**: Integration of a system prompt library will allow you to control the behavior of the LLM with predefined prompts, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Text replacement for better privacy**: Define keywords that will be replaced in your chats before sending content to the provider, enhancing your privacy.
- **Advanced interactions**: We're full of ideas for advanced interactions tailored for specific use cases, whether in a business context or for writers and other professionals.

## Building
You just want to use the app? Then simply [download the appropriate setup for your operating system](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/releases/latest). This chapter is intended for developers who want to modify and customize the code.

In order to build MindWork AI Studio from source instead of using the pre-built binaries, follow these steps:
1. Install the .NET 8 SDK.
2. Install the Rust compiler.
3. Install NuShell. This shell works on all operating systems and is required because the build script is written in NuShell.
4. Clone the repository.
5. Open a terminal with NuShell.
6. Navigate to the `/app/MindWork AI Studio` directory within the repository.
7. To build the current version, run `nu build.nu publish`.
    - This will build the app for the current operating system, for both x64 (Intel, AMD) and ARM64 (e.g., Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi).
    - The setup program will be located in `runtime/target/release/bundle` afterward.
8. To prepare a new release, run `nu build.nu prepare <ACTION>`, where `<ACTION>` is either `patch`, `minor`, or `major`.
