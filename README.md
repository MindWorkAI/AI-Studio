# MindWork AI Studio

## News
Things we are currently working on:

- Since September 2024: Work on the first personal assistant. The first personal assistant is a specialist in cognitive bias. It should be able to explain to you what biases exist. We do not want to rely on the training data of the LLM. Instead, AI Studio will bring a large catalog of bias descriptions in the future. This requires a lot of editorial work because we need to collect and revise the information. Related PR: [#166](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/166).


- Since September 2024: Experiments have been started on how we can work on long texts with AI Studio. Let's say you want to write a fantasy novel or create a complex project proposal and use LLM for support. The initial experiments were promising, but not yet satisfactory. We are testing further approaches until a satisfactory solution is found. Related PR: [#167](https://github.com/MindWorkAI/AI-Studio/pull/167).


Other News:

- October 2024: We have our first financial supporter: Thank you @richard-stanton for financially supporting AI Studio. The supporter page in the app will be updated accordingly with the next update.


- October 2024: The [German Aerospace Center (DLR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Aerospace_Center) ([Website](https://www.dlr.de/en)) will use AI Studio at least within the scope of one project and will also contribute to its further development. This is great news.


## What is AI Studio?

MindWork AI Studio is a desktop application available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. It provides a unified chat interface for Large Language Models (LLMs). You bring your own API key for the respective LLM provider to use the models. The API keys are securely stored by the operating system.

**Key advantages:**
- **Free of charge**: The app is free to use, both for personal and commercial purposes.
- **Independence**: You are not tied to any single provider. Instead, you can choose the provider that best suits their needs. Right now, we support OpenAI (GPT4o etc.), Mistral, Anthropic (Claude), and self-hosted models using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), [ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), or [Fireworks](https://fireworks.ai/). Support for Google Gemini, and [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) is planned.
- **Unrestricted usage**: Unlike services like ChatGPT, which impose limits after intensive use, MindWork AI Studio offers unlimited usage through the providers API.
- **Cost-effective**: You only pay for what you use, which can be cheaper than monthly subscription services like ChatGPT Plus, especially if used infrequently. But beware, here be dragons: For extremely intensive usage, the API costs can be significantly higher. Unfortunately, providers currently do not offer a way to display current costs in the app. Therefore, check your account with the respective provider to see how your costs are developing. When available, use prepaid and set a cost limit.
- **Privacy**: The data entered into the app is not used for training by the providers since we are using the provider's API.
- **Flexibility**: Choose the provider and model best suited for your current task.
- **No bloatware**: The app requires minimal storage for installation and operates with low memory usage. Additionally, it has a minimal impact on system resources, which is beneficial for battery life.

## Planned Features
Here's an exciting look at some of the features we're planning to add to MindWork AI Studio in future releases:

- **System prompts**: Integration of a system prompt library will allow you to control the behavior of the LLM with predefined prompts, ensuring consistency and efficiency.
- **Text replacement for better privacy**: Define keywords that will be replaced in your chats before sending content to the provider, enhancing your privacy.
- **Advanced interactions**: We're full of ideas for advanced interactions tailored for specific use cases, whether in a business context or for writers and other professionals.
